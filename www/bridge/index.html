  <h3>Our History</h3>
  <p>Meedan has a vision of a more crosslingual internet, and we have worked with hundreds of people around the world to translate millions of words into a half dozen languages. We are committed to the potential of translation as a social good, both at home and globally, with a particular focus on enabling communities to support global journalism and civic engagement.</p>

  <p>Since 2006, Meedan has led a number of groundbreaking crowdsourced translation projects, including News.Meedan, a crowdsourced translation site for journalism across the Arabic- and English-speaking webs and Speak2Tweet, an effort to translate voice messages from the Egyptian revolution. Members of Meedan bring a rich array of professional experience in crowdsourced and digital translation, including Ai Weiwei English, a dedicated translation site for the Chinese artist-activist’s Twitter.</p>

  <p>Our current collaboration with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Paul Salopek's <A HREF="http://www.outofedenwalk.com">Out of Eden Walk</A> project aims to translate tweets situated in the vicinity of his 7-year walk around the world. We are please to partner with the DOLLY Project and Translators Without Borders on this effort.</p>
