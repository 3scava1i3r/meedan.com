<p class="blurb">Bridge helps communities translate, annotate, share, and source the most compelling global content on social media. Starting with a pilot with the National Geographic Society and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Paul Salopekâ€™s Out of Eden Walk project, the product aims to support a mixed competency group of translators with powerful tools like glossaries and translation memories.</p>
