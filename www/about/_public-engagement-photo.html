  <h3>Public Engagement</h3>
  <p>We value public engagement on matters of technology, journalism and translation.

We have led workshops, panels and lectures on topics of global journalism in a variety of settings, from the Personal
Democracy Forum in New York to MITâ€™s Civic Media Center to the Stockholm Internet Forum. We are also founding members of the First Draft Coalition,
a group of journalists, technologists and human rights 
workers convened by Google News Lab to provide thought leadership and cutting edge research around verification techniques, technology and case studies.</p>
