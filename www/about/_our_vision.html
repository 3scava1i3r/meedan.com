  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>Meedan has a vision of a wider world web in which citizens can collaborate across languages.
    Today, the global web is increasingly diverse but living in silos defined by the oldest communications barrier: language.
    We look to a world where understandingâ€Š facilitated by global conversation is a bit wider, deeper, and more effective.
    Untapped language communities represent new trading markets for content, ideas, knowledge, and lolcats.</p>
    <p>To get there, we want to build the best tools and platforms in support of global journalism and translation.
      We are a team of designers, technologists and journalists who focus on open source investigation of digital media and crowdsourced translation of social media.
      With commercial, media and university partners, we support research, curriculum development, and new forms of digital storytelling.</p>
