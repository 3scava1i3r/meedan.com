  body: "In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its
    epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world,
    and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and
    delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation
    were part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight
    three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in
    Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives
    by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around
    the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented
    and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.\n\n###
    Trust Crisis in Iran   \n\nIn the months leading up to the COVID-19 crisis in
    Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s official institutions. Following
    November 2019 protests that resulted in what is suspected to have been thousands
    of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the country’s wide-reaching military corps<sup><a
    id=\"fnref1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup>, and the (semi) elected Iranian government
    faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition, the downing and the subsequent coverup
    of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in January 2020 by the Guards led to a new
    round of protests ([Behravesh, Jan. 14, 2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iran-plane-shoot-protest-crisis-competency-legitimacy-200113151404256.html)).\n\nAs
    COVID-19 began to take hold in the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei,
    President Rouhani, the Ministry of Health and other officials initially played
    down the pandemic, in fear that the virus would lower voter turnout for the country’s
    February election (Al Jazeera, Feb. 23, 2020; [BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Less reported in the media are the other issues and events that have eroded public
    trust against these authorities throughout the pandemic: Channels affiliated to
    the Revolutionary Guards and state affiliated news channels promoted conspiracy
    theories about the virus’s origins. Masaf Institute for example, a cultural and
    economic institution affiliated with Revolutionary Guard under the leadership
    of a well-known and cult-like conspiracy theorist, Ali Akbar Raefipour, stood
    out amongst these channels. They used their “health” Telegram channel called [@masaf_salam](https://t.me/masaf_salam)
    as well as it’s main channel [@masaf](https://t.me/masaf), to promote a wide range
    of conspiracies about the origins of the virus. Other accounts belonging or affiliated
    with the Revolutionary Guards such [@afsaran_ir](https://t.me/Afsaran_ir), [@sepah_cyberi](https://t.me/c/1153794295/4589),
    [@sepahcyberi](https://t.me/sepahcybery) were also actors promoting such theories.
    However, they further dramatized and promoted conspiracy theories that were being
    promoted in Iran’s official media regarding the virus as an attack by the US against
    Iran.\n\nWhile political information worked to divide and blame the origins of
    the virus, influential channels on the popular messaging service Telegram, even
    some associated with hardline and traditional institutions such as the Revolutionary
    Guards, were providing credible information by at least, [29 February](https://t.me/c/1153794295/2423),
    asking followers to follow social distancing measures and sharing videos of medical
    staff asking Iranians to stay home to save lives. \n\nOur analysis of social media
    found examples of religiously-charged COVID-19 messages promoted in India, the
    US, and MENA countries such as Iran. It is the latter that we focus on in this
    report. There is no doubt that Islam prohibts the spreading of unverified information,
    gossipes, and rumours<sup><a id=\"fnref2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup>. Yet, with
    a deficit of public trust in authorities, opportunities for information sharing
    have been allocated to unqualified actors, most significantly, clerics and religious
    figures. \n\nIn Iran, where some Shiite Muslim religious figures often use their
    faith as a pillar of opposition against westernization, a fringe figure named
    Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian has come to be known as “the father of Islamic medicine.”
    Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, Tabrizian posted a video in January of himself
    burning a copy of _Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine_, an American reference
    textbook of medicine used globally. Tabrizian accused the book of being “a tool
    of the West’s infiltration of other countries” in a video sermon posted to his
    Telegram channel (Tabrizian 2020b). \n\nThose who follow Tabrizian’s thinking
    against modern medicine are known to refuse to vaccinate, or follow medical advice,
    for major illnesses including cancer diagnoses (Faghihi 2020). On 25 February,
    as the coronavirus crisis unfolded in Iran, Tabrizian advised followers infected
    with the virus to swab their anus’ with a piece of cotton dipped in violet oil
    (See Figure 1). The post has gone viral on his Telegram channel of over 200,000
    followers and beyond onto other Persian language social media, with mixed reactions
    that included both ridicule and adherence to Tabrizian’s messaging (Tabrizian
    2020a). \n\n![A screenshot from Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian’s official Telegram
    page.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3BvGJf7b7qKzwlVwdG5QHw/a578ccf7fdadd92619bb576a2d22be8f/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Ayatollah-Abbas-Tabrizian-official-Telegram.jpg)\n\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 1: A screenshot from Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian’s official
    Telegram page. In a 25 February 2020 post, he lists 13 actions to take in an effort
    to battle an infection against coronavirus. Point 8 has been particularly shocking,
    where he advises infected followers to swab their anus with violet oil before
    bed. This screenshot was taken by the authors on 28 March 2020.</p>\n\nAnother
    controversial video that circulated across Persian language social media shows
    Mortazavi Kohsal, known to be a disciple of Ayatollah Tabrizian (Saeedian 2020;
    Bahar News 2020). As he claims to practice Islamic medicine, Kohsal visits critically
    ill and quarantined coronavirus patients, while wearing no protective clothes
    or gear, to rub a liquid he claimed to be “the perfume of the Prophet” on the
    patients lips in the city of Anzali in Gilan. Two days later, one of the young
    patients Kohsal rubbed the perfume died from the virus ([Bahar News 2020](http://www.baharnews.ir/news/206368/%D8%AF%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%87%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84)).
    \n\nIn another similar situation another follower of Tabrizian, Mehdi Sabili,
    circulated a viral video recommending camel urine as a coronavirus remedy. Authorities
    arrested himfor creating “confusion and anxiety” for the public, and undermining
    the countries “Islamic and medicinal values” in addition to running a Islamic
    Medicine clinic in Tehran without a license  ([YJC, Apr. 22, 2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7327494/%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%BA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D8%AF)).
    \n\nCriticisms against these actors and their contribution to fatal dangers within
    Iranian establishment are aplenty ([Radio Farda, Dec. 29, 2020](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/successor-to-khamenei-died-because-he-trusted-islamic-medicine-son-reveals/30349899.html)),
    however it is generally known that the phenomenon remains protected from official
    reproach through Tabrizian’s entrenched networks amongst Iran’s elite. While two
    of Tabrizian’s disciples have been arrested, after causing outrage in both internal
    Iranian and international media, Tabrizian has been left untouched, and his honorific
    title of “Ayatollah” yet to be questioned for removal by Iran’s Shiite seminaries
    ([YJC, Apr. 23, 2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7328801/%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%BE%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85))<sup><a
    id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>.  \n\nIn February 2020, three Iranian
    doctors who condemned Tabrizian’s medical advice were sentenced to flogging in
    the city of Mashad ([Asr Iran, Feb. 9, 2020](https://www.asriran.com/fa/news/712989/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AA-3-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86)<sup><a
    id=\"fnref4\" href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a></sup>). The doctors were later [acquitted](https://www.irna.ir/news/83761292/%D8%B3%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF).
    A journalist running the Telegram channel for the semi-official Iranian Labour
    News Agency (ILNA) was arrested on 23 April for posting a satirical cartoon of
    Tabrizian and his suggested coronavirus remedies on the basis of insulting the
    Supreme Leader Khamenei. The cartoon depicted Khamenei as a nurse asking for silence
    as he allows for remedies to be applied to a coronavirus patient ([RFE/RL, Apr.
    28, 2020](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-arrests-editor-journalist-over-cartoon-mocking-khamenei/30581070.html)).
    Popular platforms such as the Iranian alternative to YouTube, Aparat, that strictly
    adhere to Iran’s censorship regulations ([Center for Human Rights in Iran, Nov.
    29, 2017](https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/11/after-fiery-speech-iran-censors-ahmadinejad-related-online-searches/))
    leaves the official pages for Tabrizian prescribing and promoting remedies unchecked
    (see the page for Tabrizian’s archive of speeches [here](https://www.aparat.com/tebeslamiclip),
    and his office’s official channel [here](https://www.aparat.com/daftareayatollahtabrizian)).\n\nReligious
    authorities also falsely believed sacred protection would prevent the virus from
    spreading in religious shrines, and resistance to closing down the religious shrines
    in the city of Qom, where the virus had its first outbreak in Iran, was a contributing
    factor to the spread of the disease ([Batrawy, Feb. 25, 2020](https://apnews.com/7b8f420db1a339116d66bc55c9085d7c)).
    \n\nDespite many authorities condemning “religious misinformation”, it was still
    a phenomenon that contributed to Iran’s _infodemic_. The combination of communications
    platforms allowing for wider audiences for fanatical solutions have contributed
    to the reach and impact of dangerous ideas and remedies. Politically, the spread
    of the virus from a holy Shiite centre such as Qom has fueled the existing sectarian
    tensions within the Gulf region and Lebanon. Scapegoating problems of coronavirus
    to Shiite Islam has contributed to eroding civil rights against already persecuted
    minority Shiite communities in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain (Matthiesen 2020). \n\nOne
    of the most emblematic issues of public distrust in Iran comes around the consumption
    of alcohol. To date, over 300 Iranians have died and another 1,000 were poisoned
    by alcohol during the pandemic (Karimi and Gambrell 2020). Yet, contrary to what
    local and foriegn media has determined, this is not a problem found in the “online
    infodemic.” Alcohol related deaths have long been a problem in Iran. \n\nWhile
    there have been no public posts or channels propagating alcohol as a solution
    to our knowledge, a deficit of public trust often leads to word of mouth remedies.
    Iranians have created a cognitive dissonance avoiding official messages that kept
    failing them and replaced these messages by alternatives, which could lead to
    death in some cases (see Festinger 1957).\n\nAs an Islamic theocracy, alcohol
    is banned in the country but still widely consumed. Iranians have different ways
    of acquiring alcohol. There are alcohol dealers that sell various imported alcoholic
    drinks, typically at very high prices. An alternative, however, is making the
    alcohol at home or purchasing alcohol distilled in illegal local workshops. These
    two alternative options are often the source of poorly made distillations that
    lead to methanol poisoning. In fact, alcohol related deaths due to these poisonous
    distillations have long been a public health crisis in Iran, well before the introduction
    of the coronavirus ([Hekmat et al 2012](http://ircmj.com/articles/15765.html)).
    Alcohol poisoning has increased during the pandemic as more people have been looking
    to occupy their time at home by drinking; falsely interpreting alcohol consumption
    as a coronavirus disinfectant or remedy; and an increase in dealers selling poisonous
    alcohol ([Hamshari Online, Mar. 14 2020](http://newspaper.hamshahrionline.ir/id/96869/36%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%87.html)).
    This, combined with Iran’s existing issues of trust and access to information
    factors surrounding the virus in Iran have intensified into a record amount of
    deaths.\n\n### Politics: A Blame Game\n\nPolitical leaders in Iran have spread
    conspiracy theories that accuse other countries of spreading the virus. High ranking
    officials of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as well as the Supreme
    Leader Ayatollah Khamenei have spread the conspiracy theory that coronavirus is
    part of an American led bio attack against Iran within the country’s officialdom
    (RFE/RL 2020; Haghdoost and Motevalli 2020). \n\nWhile some unofficial religious
    leaders promoted remedies, Iranian officials promoted fake virus testing technologies,
    making a mockery of the states efforts to combat the deadly virus. In what seemed
    like a show, the IRGC unveiled what was advertised as a “coronavirus remote detector”
    that could locate people infected within a 100 meters range. News about the unveiling
    ceremony on the 15th of April was published throughout Iran’s press and spread
    throughout international media. Links about this poorly-designed public diplomacy/propaganda
    attempt have circulated on Twitter for its “scientific capacity” (see Figure 2).
    \n\n![A screenshot of a Tweet by Press TV supporting the IRGC’s coronavirus detector](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/71abbYBDpUWuJ1x90GdpIv/b147bd105274cb11c5657b5834372ed7/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Press-TV-screenshot.jpg)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 2: A screenshot of a Tweet by Press TV supporting the
    IRGC’s coronavirus detector. The screenshot was taken by the authors on the 25th
    of April 2020. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressTV/status/1250895835023499264\">Source
    link</a>.</p>\n\nOne argument about international coverage of the coronavirus
    in Iran however, is that Iran’s place as a “bad actor” or “pariah” state within
    the world, especially as a force countering U.S hegemony in the Middle East, has
    led to unbalanced reporting on the situation of the virus in Iran. As one of the
    first countries hit by the virus, analysis of Iran’s inadequate response was perceived
    as a shocking and singular demonstration of Iran’s incompetence. However, as the
    virus became a pandemic overtaking almost every country in the world, it became
    evident incompetence and inadequacy were not singular to Iran and were in fact
    a feature of even many advanced democracies.\n\nNonetheless, manipulation campaigns
    have been tied to Iran. The “International Union of Virtual Media” (IUVM) has
    been uncovered as an influence campaign tied to Iran by researchers at Graphika,
    FireEye, and Facebook (Graphika[, 2020](https://graphika.com/reports/irans-iuvm-turns-to-coronavirus/)).
    Following a headlining whistleblower report released by BBC Persian on 28 February,
    indicating the number of deaths in Iran far exceeded the government reports ([BBC,
    Feb. 28, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51673053)), IUVM TV
    ran a smear campaign calling BBC Persian reporting a British conspiracy to undermine
    Iranian authorities (see figure 3). \n\n![meedan covid-19-report iran IUVM-website-screenshot](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/20isFvyYMCrJX7FeoVOvB7/3aabc74f765b05ee5ca6574f4bf4bf66/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_IUVM-website-screenshot.jpg)\n\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 3: A screenshot of a video posted on the IUVM website,

    on the 25th of April 2020. <a href=\"https://iuvmtv.com/bbc-coronian-media-against-iran/\">Source
    link</a>.</p>\n\nGeopolitical warfare over controlling the coronavirus narrative
    continues alongside the censorship of major social media platforms, including
    \ Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Telegram and major international media outlets such
    as BBC Persian. This has helped place hurdles on access to trusted information,
    especially pertinent during the start of the spread of the virus. \n\nPrior to
    the country’s parliamentary elections information sources about the virus were
    scarce if not only on censored platforms. However, the government denied the arrival
    of the virus as “disinformation” being spread through social media ([BBC Persian,
    Feb. 16 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51521216)). \n\nFear of contradicting
    the government has also stopped many Iranians from sharing information online.
    There have been a number of arrests of medical workers exposing the true extent
    of the medical catastrophe ([ARTICLE19](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/)
    2020). Some criticism of the government’s public health responses led to high
    profile arrests, such as Shiraz City Councillor Mehdi Hajati, who on his Twitter
    account criticized authorities that did not quarantine Qom as the enemy of the
    people (Hajati 2020). \n\nIn many addresses to the nation President Rouhani has
    warned of a coronavirus _infodemic_ ([Tasnim, Mar. 14, 2020](https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1398/12/24/2222979/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B4-%D8%AF%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%85)).
    The consequences authorities have distributed, except in the two high profile
    cases of the fringereligious actors , have mostly been arrests and crackdowns
    related to criticisms against the response of the varying institutions of the
    Islamic Republic.\n\n### Counter-Measures\n\nWhile misinformation is circulated,
    counter-measures were barely implemented in the MENA region. Old coercive methods
    have been imposed, like arrests. MENA governments have launched more “threats”
    to those who spread rumours – or anything that contradicts the official news –
    on social media in relation to coronavirus, accusing them of affecting the public
    order.Coronavirus “misinformation” has become another reason to put more people
    behind bars in this region. There have been a number of arrests in Iran due to
    spreading “misinformation” on social media. To enforce that, the Iranian government
    created a task force to combat “misinformation” and “the spread of fear” leading
    to at least 24 arrests ([ARTICLE19](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/),
    2020). While official measures did not help counter the spread of misinformation,
    measures implemented by social media platforms did not seem to help either. \n\nSocial
    media use in Western contexts are mainly dominated by platforms owned by Google,
    Facebook and Twitter. Although they operate imperfectly, there have been channels
    for criticism and accountability for the policies and decisions these companies
    take for fighting misinformation by civil society and governments. Within the
    Iranian context, the platforms used are more complex. According to a 2019 poll
    done by the Islamic Student Polling Agency, the top three most used social media
    applications (not including streaming platforms) are WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram
    (in that order of popularity) ([ISPA 2019](http://ispa.ir/Default/Details/fa/2095)).
    [Iran’s Alexa ranking](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/IR) for websites
    also lists the local video streaming platform Aparat as the second most visited
    website in Iran (Alexa 2020). \n\nWhat is emblematic of Iran’s information spaces
    are the lack of oversight that can be afforded to flag or remove false information.
    Viral news stories or videos forwarded in private chats or WhatsApp groups have
    become an emblem of COVID19’s Iranian infodemic. As researchers, this phenomenon
    is hard to track and trace across WhatsApp beyond interviews done with Iranians.
    In terms of oversight of the virality of false information on the platform, WhatsApp
    has struggled to find solutions. These struggles are naturally inherent in the
    nature of the platform as a private and encrypted messaging<sup><a id=\"fnref5\"
    href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>.  \n\nAs the second most popular social media platform
    in Iran, Telegram’s major role lies in its public channels, which have been a
    platform for false information during the coronavirus pandemic. Content moderation
    policies on Telegram are notoriously more lax and subject to fewer accountability
    oversight mechanisms. This might be a product of how niche its social media function
    is within only certain communities or countries. However, as the “infodemic” within
    the coronavirus pandemic has become a global issue of universal relevance in almost
    every community and country, Telegram introduced a system to verify its channels
    in April in order to fight against dangerous coronavirus mis/disinformation<sup><a
    id=\"fnref6\" href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup>. \n\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic,
    problematic channels such as that of [Ayatollah Tabrizian’](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)s,
    propagating his false remedies according to the dictates of his own school of
    “Islamic Medicine” have circulated unchecked. However, many channels affiliated
    with authorities did publish legitimate information that might have been ignored
    due to the crisis of legitimacy that exists between citizens and authorities.\n\nIn
    an official attempt to raise awareness, the Iranian government raised concerns
    about coronavirus misinformation as an issue mainly from “enemies.” Before official
    orders were given to lockdown public spaces, businesses, and restaurants in Iran,
    President Rouhani indicated “it is the conspiracy of our enemies to create fear
    to shut down our country” ([BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Instead of promoting media literacy in the country, the government flagged these
    warnings to further cement the theory of “western influence” in creating or worsening
    the situation or to deflect from government criticism. While official efforts
    were lacking to counter the spread of misleading information in Iran, independent
    fact-checking efforts were also lacking. \n\nThe MENA region, in general, lacks
    fact-checking efforts. Only a few local fact checkers work on countering Arabic
    and Persian misinformation in relation to coronavirus at the time of writing.
    AFP Factual and Fatabyyano are among those few entities that run coronavirus fact
    checking efforts, and act as the official Facebook third-party fact checkers in
    the region (See more on [Google Fact Check Tools](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer/search/coronavirus;hl=)
    and [IFCN](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories)). Others, in
    a less formal way, run fact-checking efforts like Verify-Syria, Factnameh, Matsda2sh,
    and Misbar – all are currently focusing on coronavirus fact-checking. [BBC Monitoring](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51677530)
    has done some work to dispel misinformation on Persian social media, however their
    analyses are only in the English language (Sardarizadeh 2020). \n\nWhile this
    region lacks fact-checking efforts, social media platforms have also never prioritized
    collaborating with third-party fact checkers in the region. To this date, Facebook,
    for example, has only two partners that cover the entire MENA region ([Elswah
    & Howard, 2020](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/tunisia-election-memo/)).
    While social media platforms have spent resources in directing their users to
    accurate coronavirus-information in the MENA region, a lot still needs to be done,
    including developing their algorithms, content moderation, and fact-checking.\n\n###
    Conclusions\n\nThe world is currently witnessing an unprecedented challenge that
    threatens people’s lives. The MENA region has long been suffering from other problems
    like illiteracy, corruption, and authoritarianism. Coronavirus has added one more
    challenge to this region’s unprepared governments. In this short report, we presented
    how coronavirus has been used for religious and political polarization. While
    we focused our attention on Iran -the epicenter of the virus in the region- there
    are systemic issues that plague the information environment in Iran that are reflected
    into the rest of the region. From issues of unofficial religious actors, lack
    of trust in authorities, and political polarisations. \n\nWhile Islam encourages
    Muslims to verify information and prohibit its followers from misleading others,
    some unofficial religious figures used their authority and connections to the
    political elite to mislead their communities and have remained unpenalized. Religious
    misinformation has had the ability to further politicize government responses
    to this pandemic. From shifting government accountability about appropriate measures
    to quarantine epicentres, to using excuses to persecute religious minorities in
    Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Politicization of the pandemic across geopolitical tensions
    has been a particular highlight in the spread of misinformation from officialdom
    across the MENA region. \n\nConspiracy theories about American bio-attacks against
    Iran have led to pressure to go as far as to stop Doctors Without Borders from
    setting up and manning a hospital in the city of Isfahan as a continuation of
    long-standing projects in Iran and coordinated with the country’s Ministry of
    Health ([MSF, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/iranian-authorities-revoke-approval-msf-coronavirus-treatment-center);
    [Motevalli, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/french-charity-msf-says-iran-coronavirus-aid-is-on-hold)).
    Information control practices such as internet censorship and arrests of critics
    of the government has further added to the deficit in public trust against governments
    in this region. This has exacerbated the spread of misinformation, leading to
    hundreds of fatalities. \n\nWhile the MENA region has not monopolized examples
    of coronavirus misinformation, the examples we outlined above highlight the deeper
    problems of authoritarianism, literacy (or digital literacy), sectarian tensions,
    and geopolitical conflicts that are worsening what should be a region united—in
    terms of nations, regions, and religions—against a global pandemic that knows
    no borders. "
