  body: "In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its
    epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world,
    and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and
    delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation
    were part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight
    three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in
    Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives
    by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around
    the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented
    and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.\n\n###
    Trust Crisis in Iran\n\n#### Political Turbulence and Trust\n\nIn the months leading
    up to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s
    official institutions. Following November 2019 protests that resulted in what
    is suspected to have been thousands of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the
    country’s wide-reaching military corps<sup><a id=\"fnref1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup>,
    and the (semi) elected Iranian government faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition,
    the downing and the subsequent coverup of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in
    January 2020 by the Guards led to a new round of protests ([Behravesh, Jan. 14,
    2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iran-plane-shoot-protest-crisis-competency-legitimacy-200113151404256.html)).\n\nAs
    COVID-19 began to take hold in the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei,
    President Rouhani, the Ministry of Health and other officials initially played
    down the pandemic, in fear that the virus would lower voter turnout for the country’s
    February election ([BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Less reported in the media are the other issues and events that have eroded public
    trust against these authorities throughout the pandemic: Channels affiliated to
    the Revolutionary Guards and state affiliated news channels promoted conspiracy
    theories about the virus’s origins. Masaf Institute for example, a cultural and
    economic institution affiliated with Revolutionary Guard under the leadership
    of a well-known and cult-like conspiracy theorist, Ali Akbar Raefipour, stood
    out amongst these channels. They used their “health” Telegram channel called [@masaf_salam](https://t.me/masaf_salam)
    as well as it’s main channel [@masaf](https://t.me/masaf), to promote a wide range
    of conspiracies about the origins of the virus. Other accounts belonging or affiliated
    with the Revolutionary Guards such [@afsaran_ir](https://t.me/Afsaran_ir), [@sepah_cyberi](https://t.me/c/1153794295/4589),
    [@sepahcyberi](https://t.me/sepahcybery) were also actors promoting such theories.
    However, they further dramatized and promoted conspiracy theories that were being
    promoted in Iran’s official media regarding the virus as an attack by the US against
    Iran.\n\nWhile political information worked to divide and blame the origins of
    the virus, influential channels on the popular messaging service Telegram, even
    some associated with hardline and traditional institutions such as the Revolutionary
    Guards, were providing credible information by at least, [29 February](https://t.me/c/1153794295/2423),
    asking followers to follow social distancing measures and sharing videos of medical
    staff asking Iranians to stay home to save lives. \n\n#### Religious Figures Fill
    Trust Vacuum\n\nOur analysis of social media found examples of religiously-charged
    COVID-19 messages promoted in India, the US, and MENA countries such as Iran.
    It is the latter that we focus on in this report. There is no doubt that Islam
    prohibts the spreading of unverified information, gossipes, and rumours<sup><a
    id=\"fnref2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup>. Yet, with a deficit of public trust
    in authorities, opportunities for information sharing have been allocated to unqualified
    actors, most significantly, clerics and religious figures. \n\nIn Iran, where
    some Shiite Muslim religious figures often use their faith as a pillar of opposition
    against westernization, a fringe figure named Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian has come
    to be known as “the father of Islamic medicine.” Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19,
    Tabrizian [posted a video](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian/6965) in January
    of himself burning a copy of _Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine_, an
    American reference textbook of medicine used globally. Tabrizian accused the book
    of being “a tool of the West’s infiltration of other countries” in a video sermon
    posted to his Telegram channel. \n\nThose who follow Tabrizian’s thinking against
    modern medicine are known to refuse to vaccinate, or follow medical advice, for
    major illnesses including cancer diagnoses ([Faghihi, Mar. 10, 2020](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/bizarre-cures-for-coronavirus-in-iran.html)).
    On 25 February, as the coronavirus crisis unfolded in Iran, Tabrizian advised
    followers infected with the virus to swab their anus’ with a piece of cotton dipped
    in violet oil (See Figure 1). The [post](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)
    has gone viral on his Telegram channel of over 200,000 followers and beyond onto
    other Persian language social media, with mixed reactions that included both ridicule
    and adherence to Tabrizian’s messaging. \n\n![meedan covid-19-report iran Ayatollah-Abbas-Tabrizian-official-Telegram-3](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7tCYRd8B523rGfF2DF4UTt/ae60d6c86fc30b83d24f38ce0e1ce0d4/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Ayatollah-Abbas-Tabrizian-official-Telegram-3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 1: A screenshot from Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian’s official
    Telegram page. In a 25 February 2020 post, he lists 13 actions to take in an effort
    to battle an infection against coronavirus. Point 8 has been particularly shocking,
    where he advises infected followers to swab their anus with violet oil before
    bed. This screenshot was taken by the authors on 28 March 2020.</p>\n\nAnother
    controversial video that circulated across Persian language social media shows
    Mortazavi Kohsal, known to be a disciple of Ayatollah Tabrizian ([Saeedian, Mar.
    23, 2020](https://twitter.com/mahdiarsaeedian/status/1241289478301499392); Bahar
    News, Mar. 23, 2020). As he claims to practice Islamic medicine, Kohsal visits
    critically ill and quarantined coronavirus patients, while wearing no protective
    clothes or gear, to rub a liquid he claimed to be “the perfume of the Prophet”
    on the patients lips in the city of Anzali in Gilan. Two days later, one of the
    young patients Kohsal rubbed the perfume died from the virus ([Bahar News, Mar.
    23, 2020](http://www.baharnews.ir/news/206368/%D8%AF%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%87%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84)).
    \n\nMehdi Sabili, another follower of Tabrizian, similarly circulated a viral
    video recommending camel urine as a coronavirus remedy. Authorities arrested himfor
    creating “confusion and anxiety” for the public, and undermining the countries
    “Islamic and medicinal values” in addition to running a Islamic Medicine clinic
    in Tehran without a license  ([YJC, Apr. 22, 2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7327494/%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%BA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D8%AF)).
    \n\n#### Protection for Religious Misinformers\n\nCriticisms against these actors
    and their contribution to fatal dangers within the Iranian establishment are aplenty
    ([Radio Farda, Dec. 29, 2020](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/successor-to-khamenei-died-because-he-trusted-islamic-medicine-son-reveals/30349899.html)).
    However the phenomenon remains protected from official reproach through Tabrizian’s
    entrenched networks amongst Iran’s clerical elite. While two of Tabrizian’s disciples
    have been arrested after causing outrage in both internal Iranian and international
    media, Tabrizian has been left untouched. His honorific title of “Ayatollah” has
    never been questioned for removal by Iran’s Shiite seminaries ([YJC, Apr. 23,
    2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7328801/%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%BE%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85))<sup><a
    id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>.  \n\nIn February 2020, three Iranian
    doctors who condemned Tabrizian’s medical advice were sentenced to flogging in
    the city of Mashhad ([Asr Iran, Feb. 9, 2020](https://www.asriran.com/fa/news/712989/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AA-3-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86))<sup><a
    id=\"fnref4\" href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a></sup>. While the doctors were later [acquitted](https://www.irna.ir/news/83761292/%D8%B3%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF),
    these arrests highlight Tabrizian’s influence with authorities. Furthermore, a
    journalist running the Telegram channel for the semi-official Iranian Labour News
    Agency (ILNA) was arrested on 23 April for posting a satirical cartoon of Tabrizian
    and his suggested coronavirus remedies on the basis of insulting the Supreme Leader
    Khamenei. The cartoon depicted Khamenei as a nurse asking for silence as he allows
    for remedies to be applied to a coronavirus patient ([RFE/RL, Apr. 28, 2020](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-arrests-editor-journalist-over-cartoon-mocking-khamenei/30581070.html)).
    Popular platforms such as the Iranian alternative to YouTube, Aparat, that strictly
    adhere to Iran’s censorship regulations ([Center for Human Rights in Iran, Nov.
    29, 2017](https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/11/after-fiery-speech-iran-censors-ahmadinejad-related-online-searches/))
    leaves the official pages for Tabrizian prescribing and promoting remedies unchecked
    (see the page for Tabrizian’s archive of speeches [here](https://www.aparat.com/tebeslamiclip),
    and his office’s official channel [here](https://www.aparat.com/daftareayatollahtabrizian)).\n\nReligious
    authorities also falsely believed sacred protection would prevent the virus from
    spreading in religious shrines, and resistance to closing down the religious shrines
    in the city of Qom, where the virus had its first outbreak in Iran, was a contributing
    factor to the spread of the disease ([Batrawy, Feb. 25, 2020](https://apnews.com/7b8f420db1a339116d66bc55c9085d7c)).
    However, as the pandemic has carried on for a few months, some clerical figures,
    especially in Qom, have come to be seen as community leaders in guiding public
    health on good advice ([Bozorgmehr, Jun. 17, 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/8e9b50bb-ebf7-4702-9894-1f2081ae869a)).\n\nDespite
    many authorities condemning “religious misinformation”, it was still a phenomenon
    that contributed to Iran’s _infodemic_. The combination of communications platforms
    allowing for wider audiences for fanatical solutions have contributed to the reach
    and impact of dangerous ideas and remedies. Politically, the spread of the virus
    from a holy Shiite centre such as Qom has fueled the existing sectarian tensions
    within the Gulf region and Lebanon. Scapegoating problems of coronavirus to Shiite
    Islam has contributed to eroding civil rights against already persecuted minority
    Shiite communities in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain ([Matthiesen, Mar. 23, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2020-03-23/coronavirus-exacerbating-sectarian-tensions-middle-east)).\n\n####
    The Alcohol Epidemic Within the Pandemic: Not Part of the Online Infodemic\n\nTo
    date, over 300 Iranians have died and another 1,000 were poisoned by alcohol during
    the pandemic ([Karimi and Gambrell, Mar. 27, 2020](https://apnews.com/6e04783f95139b5f87a5febe28d72015?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP)).
    Contrary to some sources promoted by foriegn media, this was not a problem found
    in the “online infodemic.<sup><a id=\"fnref5\" href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>” Alcohol
    related deaths have long been a problem in Iran. Conditions of the lockdown have
    just exacerbated it. \n\nAs an Islamic theocracy, alcohol is banned in the country
    but still widely consumed. Iranians have different ways of acquiring alcohol.
    There are alcohol dealers that sell various imported alcoholic drinks, typically
    at very high prices. A cheaper alternative, however, is making the alcohol at
    home or purchasing alcohol distilled in illegal local workshops. The latter options
    are often the source of poorly made distillations that lead to methanol poisoning.
    In fact, alcohol related deaths due to these poisonous distillations have long
    been a public health crisis in Iran, well before the introduction of the coronavirus
    ([Hekmat et al 2012](http://ircmj.com/articles/15765.html)). Alcohol poisoning
    has increased during the pandemic as more people have been looking to occupy their
    time at home by drinking; falsely interpreting alcohol consumption as a coronavirus
    disinfectant or remedy; and an increase in dealers selling poisonous alcohol ([Hamshari](http://newspaper.hamshahrionline.ir/id/96869/36%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%87.html)[
    Online, Mar. 14 2020](http://newspaper.hamshahrionline.ir/id/96869/36%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%87.html)).
    This, combined with Iran’s existing issues of trust and access to information
    factors surrounding the virus in Iran have intensified into a record amount of
    deaths.\n\n### The Role of Geopolitics in Misinformation\n\n#### Conspiracy Theories\n\nPolitical
    leaders in Iran have spread conspiracy theories that accuse other countries of
    spreading the virus. High ranking officials of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards
    Corps (IRGC), as well as the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei have spread the
    conspiracy theory that coronavirus is part of an American led bio attack against
    Iran within the country’s officialdom ([Haghdoost and Motevalli, Mar. 12, ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/iran-s-khamenei-says-virus-outbreak-may-be-biological-attack)[2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/iran-s-khamenei-says-virus-outbreak-may-be-biological-attack)).
    \n\nWhile some unofficial religious leaders promoted remedies, Iranian officials
    promoted fake virus testing technologies, making a mockery of the states efforts
    to combat the deadly virus. In what seemed like a show, the IRGC unveiled what
    was advertised as a “coronavirus remote detector” that could locate people infected
    within a 100 meters range. News about the unveiling ceremony on the 15th of April
    was published throughout Iran’s press and spread throughout international media.
    Links about this poorly-designed public diplomacy/propaganda attempt have circulated
    on Twitter for its “scientific capacity” (see Figure2). \n\n![meedan covid-19-report
    iran Press-TV-screenshot-3](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/2JcRouH88cRjNCjkQ11dlQ/191c9729314ed1c17fa59c2f1485a0cf/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Press-TV-screenshot-3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 2: A screenshot of a Tweet by Press TV supporting the
    IRGC’s coronavirus detector. The screenshot was taken by the authors on the 25th
    of April 2020.</p>\n\n#### Information Controls\n\nOne argument about international
    coverage of the coronavirus in Iran however, is that Iran’s place as a “bad actor”
    or “pariah” state within the world, especially as a force countering U.S hegemony
    in the Middle East, has led to unbalanced reporting on the situation of the virus
    in Iran. As one of the first countries hit by the virus, analysis of Iran’s inadequate
    response was perceived as a shocking and singular demonstration of Iran’s incompetence.
    However, as the virus became a pandemic overtaking almost every country in the
    world, it became evident incompetence and inadequacy were not singular to Iran.
    Many advanced democracies struggled just as Iran did. This imbalance in foreign
    media coverage further exasperated confusions in what trusted sources could be.
    Authorities made an extra effort to tarnish the work of foreign media coverage
    of the virus in Iran as malicious.  In May. President Rouhani announced foreign
    media purposely manipulated news of the virus to “close down our country” ([IRNA
    News, May. 16, 2020](https://www.irna.ir/news/83789038/%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A8%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B7%DB%8C%D9%84-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF)).
    \n\nNevertheless, manipulation campaigns have been tied to Iran. The “International
    Union of Virtual Media” (IUVM) has been uncovered as an influence campaign tied
    to Iran by researchers at Graphika, FireEye, and Facebook ([Graphika, Apr. 14,
    2020](https://graphika.com/reports/irans-iuvm-turns-to-coronavirus/)). On 28 February
    BBC Persian published a whistleblower report that proved the number of deaths
    in Iran far exceeded the government reports ([BBC, Feb. 28, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51673053)).
    Shortly afterwards IUVM TV ran a smear campaign calling BBC Persian reporting
    a British conspiracy to undermine Iranian authorities (see figure 3). \n\n![A
    screenshot of a video posted on the IUVM website](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1YmSSDLn4bT5xi0dHqRBP0/3273db2399cd30487084692c9e141449/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_IUVM-website-screenshot_3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 3: A screenshot of a video posted on the IUVM website,
    indicating BBC Persian’s reporting on Iran’s coronavirus cases and responses are
    part of a British conspiracy against Iran. The screenshot was taken by the authors
    on the 25th of April 2020.</p> \n\nGeopolitical warfare over controlling the coronavirus
    narrative continues alongside the censorship of major social media platforms,
    including  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Telegram and major international media
    outlets such as BBC Persian. This has helped place hurdles on access to trusted
    information, especially pertinent during the start of the spread of the virus.
    \n\nPrior to the country’s parliamentary elections information sources about the
    virus were scarce if not only on censored platforms. However, the government denied
    the arrival of the virus as “disinformation” being spread through social media
    ([BBC Persian, Feb. 16 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51521216)). \n\nFear
    of contradicting the government has also stopped many Iranians from sharing information
    online. There have been a number of arrests of medical workers exposing the true
    extent of the medical catastrophe ([ARTICLE19](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/),
    Mar. 27,[ 2020](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/)).
    Some criticism of the government’s public health responses led to high profile
    arrests, such as Shiraz City Councillor Mehdi Hajati, who on his [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mehdihajati/status/1237649682953715712)
    criticized authorities that did not quarantine Qom as the enemy of the people.\n\nIn
    many addresses to the nation President Rouhani has warned of a coronavirus _infodemic_
    ([Tasnim, Mar. 14, 2020](https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1398/12/24/2222979/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B4-%D8%AF%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%85)).
    While figures such as Tabrizian have been exempt, authorities have been known
    to crack down on those criticizing the states as opposed to actors producing dangerous
    misinformation.\n\n### Counter-Measures\n\nWhile misinformation is circulated,
    counter-measures were barely implemented in the MENA region. Old coercive methods
    have been imposed, like arrests. MENA governments have launched more “threats”
    to those who spread rumours – or anything that contradicts the official news –
    on social media in relation to coronavirus, accusing them of affecting the public
    order.Coronavirus “misinformation” has become another reason to put more people
    behind bars in this region. There have been a number of arrests in Iran due to
    spreading “misinformation” on social media. To enforce that, the Iranian government
    created a task force to combat “misinformation” and “the spread of fear” leading
    to at least 24 arrests ([ARTICLE19, Mar. 27. 2020](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/)).
    While official measures did not help counter the spread of misinformation, measures
    implemented by social media platforms did not seem to help either. \n\n#### Social
    Media Platforms and Misinformation\n\nSocial media use in Western contexts are
    mainly dominated by platforms owned by Google, Facebook and Twitter. Although
    they operate imperfectly, there have been channels for criticism and accountability
    for the policies and decisions these companies take for fighting misinformation
    by civil society and governments. Within the Iranian context, the platforms used
    are more complex. According to a 2019 poll done by the Islamic Student Polling
    Agency, the top three most used social media applications (not including streaming
    platforms) are WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram (in that order of popularity)
    ([ISPA, Apr. 30, 2019](http://ispa.ir/Default/Details/fa/2095)). [Iran’s Alexa
    ranking](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/IR) for websites also lists
    the local video streaming platform Aparat as the second most visited website in
    Iran . \n\nWhat is emblematic of Iran’s information spaces are the lack of oversight
    that can be afforded to flag or remove false information. Viral news stories or
    videos forwarded in private chats or WhatsApp groups have become an emblem of
    COVID19’s Iranian infodemic. As researchers, this phenomenon is hard to track
    and trace across WhatsApp beyond interviews done with Iranians. In terms of oversight
    of the virality of false information on the platform, WhatsApp has struggled to
    find solutions. These struggles are naturally inherent in the nature of the platform
    as a private and encrypted messaging<sup><a id=\"fnref6\" href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup>.
    \ \n\nAs the second most popular social media platform in Iran, Telegram’s major
    role lies in its public channels, which have been a platform for false information
    during the coronavirus pandemic. Content moderation policies on Telegram are notoriously
    more lax and subject to fewer accountability oversight mechanisms. This might
    be a product of how niche its social media function is within only certain communities
    or countries. However, as the “infodemic” within the coronavirus pandemic has
    become a global issue of universal relevance in almost every community and country,
    Telegram introduced a system to verify its channels in April in order to fight
    against dangerous coronavirus mis/disinformation<sup><a id=\"fnref7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a></sup>.\n\n####
    Misinformation Mitigation in Iran\n\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, problematic
    channels such as that of [Ayatollah ](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)[Tabrizian’](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)s,
    propagating false remedies according to the dictates of his own school of “Islamic
    Medicine” have circulated unchecked. However, many channels affiliated with authorities
    did publish legitimate information that might have been ignored due to the crisis
    of legitimacy that exists between citizens and authorities.\n\nIn an official
    attempt to raise awareness, the Iranian government raised concerns about coronavirus
    misinformation as an issue mainly from “enemies.” Before official orders were
    given to lockdown public spaces, businesses, and restaurants in Iran, President
    Rouhani indicated “it is the conspiracy of our enemies to create fear to shut
    down our country” ([BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Instead of promoting media literacy in the country, the government flagged these
    warnings to further cement the theory of “western influence” in creating or worsening
    the situation or to deflect from government criticism. While official efforts
    were lacking to counter the spread of misleading information in Iran, independent
    fact-checking efforts were also lacking.\n\n#### Independent Fact-Checking\n\nThe
    MENA region, in general, lacks fact-checking efforts. Only a few local fact checkers
    work on countering Arabic and Persian misinformation in relation to coronavirus
    at the time of writing. AFP Factual and Fatabyyano are among those few entities
    that run coronavirus fact checking efforts, and act as the official Facebook third-party
    fact checkers in the region (See more on [Google Fact Check Tools](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer/search/coronavirus;hl=)
    and [IFCN](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories)). Others, in
    a less formal way, run fact-checking efforts like Verify-Syria, Factnameh, Matsda2sh,
    and Misbar – all are currently focusing on coronavirus fact-checking. [BBC Monitoring](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51677530)
    has done some work to dispel misinformation on Persian social media, however their
    analyses are only in the English language ([Sardarizadeh, Feb. 29, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530)).
    \n\nHowever, this region lacks fact-checking efforts, social media platforms have
    also never prioritized collaborating with third-party fact checkers in the region.To
    this date, Facebook, for example, has only two partners that cover the entire
    MENA region ([Elswah & Howard, Mar. 29, 2020](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/tunisia-election-memo/)).
    While social media platforms have spent resources in directing their users to
    accurate coronavirus-information in the MENA region, a lot still needs to be done,
    including developing their algorithms, content moderation, and fact-checking.\n\n###
    Conclusions\n\nThe world is currently witnessing an unprecedented challenge that
    threatens people’s lives. The MENA region has long been suffering from other problems
    like illiteracy, corruption, and authoritarianism. Coronavirus has added one more
    challenge to this region’s unprepared governments. In this short report, we presented
    how coronavirus has been used for religious and political polarization. While
    we focused our attention on Iran -the epicenter of the virus in the region- there
    are systemic issues that plague the information environment in Iran that are reflected
    into the rest of the region. From issues of unofficial religious actors, lack
    of trust in authorities, and political polarisations. \n\nWhile Islam encourages
    Muslims to verify information and prohibit its followers from misleading others,
    some unofficial religious figures used their authority and connections to the
    political elite to mislead their communities and have remained unpenalized. Religious
    misinformation has had the ability to further politicize government responses
    to this pandemic. From shifting government accountability about appropriate measures
    to quarantine epicentres, to using excuses to persecute religious minorities in
    Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Politicization of the pandemic across geopolitical tensions
    has been a particular highlight in the spread of misinformation from officialdom
    across the MENA region. \n\nConspiracy theories about American bio-attacks against
    Iran have led to pressure to go as far as to stop Doctors Without Borders from
    setting up and manning a hospital in the city of Isfahan as a continuation of
    long-standing projects in Iran and coordinated with the country’s Ministry of
    Health ([MSF, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/iranian-authorities-revoke-approval-msf-coronavirus-treatment-center);
    [Motevalli, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/french-charity-msf-says-iran-coronavirus-aid-is-on-hold)).
    Information control practices such as internet censorship and arrests of critics
    of the government has further added to the deficit in public trust against governments
    in this region. This has exacerbated the spread of misinformation, leading to
    hundreds of fatalities. \n\nWhile the MENA region has not monopolized examples
    of coronavirus misinformation, the examples we outlined above highlight the deeper
    problems of authoritarianism, literacy (or digital literacy), sectarian tensions,
    and geopolitical conflicts that are worsening what should be a region united—in
    terms of nations, regions, and religions—against a global pandemic that knows
    no borders. "

  body: "In this paper, we focus on our experience of harmful false information about
    health in Kenya. We identify major trends and discuss the contextual factors influencing
    mis- and disinformation in the country. We show that while there has been a surge
    in false information linked to Covid-19, this is not new to the country, with
    health myths that lead to vaccine hesitancy having a long tail, for example. Finally,
    we suggest areas that fact-checkers can look into to counter harmful health mis-
    and disinformation.\n\n### Introduction\n\nFalse information about health causes
    real harm to people’s lives. Africa Check has been fact-checking public statements
    about health in Kenya since late 2016. \n\nIn our first two years of operation
    in the country we focused on claims made by public figures, institutions or the
    media that we judged would cause the most harm if left unchallenged. In that period
    our experience was mainly of **misinformation**, with many journalists, people
    and entities publicly sharing content that they likely did not know was false.\n\nThis
    ranged from government officials making inaccurate claims about the prevalence
    of HIV/AIDS in adolescents at major international meetings<sup><a id=\"fnref1\"
    href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup> to poor fact-checking by both local and international
    media, with cited statistics often being either deficient<sup><a id=\"fnref2\"
    href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup> or non-existent<sup><a id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>.\n\nOur
    experience of **disinformation** (deliberately falsified information) in that
    period included dangerous claims about vaccines, with significant opposition fanned
    by conservative groups to tetanus vaccines<sup><a id=\"fnref4\" href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a></sup>
    for example. Churches play a major role in Kenyan society and were quite instrumental
    in seeding this. We have seen a resurgence of disinformation around vaccines due
    to the Covid-19 pandemic, including claims<sup><a id=\"fnref5\" href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>
    that the continent would be used for trials.\n\nThere has also been broader public
    awareness about disinformation in recent years, resulting in more people flagging
    questionable health content to us. This has given us greater insight into the
    types of false information shared in the country, from the occasional hoax to
    outright fabricated content and miracle cures for cancer<sup><a id=\"fnref6\"
    href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup> and other diseases of concern to Kenyans. \n\nBut
    we have noted **two key trends** in the country that are pre-eminent:\n\n- The
    use of **false context** (including false connection and clickbait headlines)\n-
    \ **Manipulation** of genuine content\n\nDecontextualisation often involves the
    use of genuine imagery re-shared as new, whether during everyday discussions of
    public health or during a major news event such as the Covid-19 crisis. Certain
    media, such as pictures and videos, have an intrinsic ability to make text appear
    more believable.\n\nManipulation is mainly doctored or tampered-with content.
    It is also notable that the two types of disinformation provide a low “barrier
    to entry” compared to say, deepfakes — or even shallowfakes.\n\nWhat the two have
    in common is the use of genuine content as a starting point. But there is also
    an added element of profit-seeking involved where believability is used to scam
    people or drive traffic to websites. This is rather surprising as we expected
    that, for reasons of structural deficiency around healthcare, including affordability,
    most false information would be about cures. \n\nHowever, it isn’t completely
    dissociated. The use of genuine content as a jumping-off point provides a sort
    of beachhead strategy into the other forms of disinformation mentioned, whether
    being screenshots appearing to be from credible sources that push false information
    to those that rely on heuristics to stoke emotion and drive virality.   \n\nThis
    is important from the perspective of both amplification and fact-checking, because
    studies show that content with a kernel of truth tends to be most shared<sup><a
    id=\"fnref7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a></sup>, and is also best countered by acknowledging
    this<sup><a id=\"fnref8\" href=\"#fn8\">[8]</a></sup>.\n\n### Contextual factors
    influencing mis- and disinformation in Kenya \n\nA number of factors are at play.
    All broadly coalesce around financial, political, and social and cultural motivations.
    \n\n- Of the 9.9 million people who use the internet in the country, 6.3 million
    — nearly two-thirds (64%) — are young people aged between 15 and 34<sup><a id=\"fnref9\"
    href=\"#fn9\">[9]</a></sup>. **But digital literacy remains low, with a notable
    digital divide where many are offline.** Our research<sup><a id=\"fnref10\" href=\"#fn10\">[10]</a></sup>
    also shows that while all demographics are vulnerable to false information, older
    people and people with lower levels of education in general are at increased fallibility.
    \n\n- **Youth unemployment** is also high<sup><a id=\"fnref11\" href=\"#fn11\">[11]</a></sup>,
    with many young people seeking to leverage the country’s increased connectivity
    to gain from a growing digital economy. This informs why false health information
    often involves scams seeking to make profit by duping potential job applicants,
    sites looking to make money off advertising and those people looking to sell hope
    to the desperate through false and untested cures. \n\n- There is also **low investment
    in quality public healthcare**, while private hospitals are largely still out
    of reach for most. In many families in Kenya, a cancer diagnosis is a sure path
    to financial ruin. This makes many Kenyans particularly vulnerable to unproven
    cures being peddled on social networks.\n\n- **Culture** also plays a role. Worldviews
    in Kenya tend to lean towards the communal rather than the ideological, and are
    very experiential. Community leaders for example have a lot of influence on society,
    and beliefs play an elevated role in how information is processed. False cures
    and anti-vaccination positions pushed by figures of authority are some of the
    ways this is manifested.Related to this is an inherent elevation of social consensus
    information. There is an innate belief that because a certain piece of information
    is being shared in groups Kenyans are members of (such as Whatsapp groups), it
    is being done in good faith and that it also is “pre-verified” and accurate. This
    informs why authority figures successfully share false information — such as a
    prominent senator who claimed<sup><a id=\"fnref12\" href=\"#fn12\">[12]</a></sup>
    soya causes breast cancer, or Nairobi’s incumbent governor claiming<sup><a id=\"fnref13\"
    href=\"#fn13\">[13]</a></sup> that alcohol is a ‘throat disinfectant’ against
    the new coronavirus.\n\n- There is also **a distrust of authority**, though not
    of experts, giving alternative voices such as bloggers and influencers a growing
    audience. These invest their time capital into the system for a return in social
    capital (likes and follows), and in algorithmic capital. Facebook groups and trending
    topics are for example quite influential in Kenya, and the players use this mainly
    for economic capital, in a sort of permissive feedback loop well outlined by Danil
    Mikhailov<sup><a id=\"fnref14\" href=\"#fn14\">[14]</a></sup>.\n\n### Examples
    of mis- and disinformation in Kenya\n\n#### Incorrect public pronouncements not
    based on, and/or misrepresenting verifiable data\n\nNairobi governor Mike Sonko
    [includes alcohol in food packs](https://africacheck.org/spot-check/nairobi-governor-sonko-puts-families-at-risk-with-coronavirus-busting-alcohol-in-food-packs/)
    to poor families, claiming that “alcohol plays a very major role in killing the
    coronavirus or any sort of virus”.\n\n#### False cures/prevention regimens\n\nFalse
    cancer cures from [a mysterious ‘Dr Gupta’](https://africacheck.org/spot-check/beware-false-cancer-cures-from-dr-gupta-on-facebook/)
    — that cancer will “disappear” if patients stop eating sugar, drink lemon juice
    before meals for three months, and take spoonfuls of coconut oil morning and night
    — go viral on Facebook.\n\n#### Hoaxes and scams\n\n[Job openings at WHO for a
    high salary](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/coronavirus-job-scam-no-world-health-organization-kenya-not-hiring-on-facebook/):
    applicants were asked to submit their personal information, with enough information
    being asked for to initiate identity theft. \n\n#### Manipulated and/or out-of-context
    videos and images\n\n [‘Every Kenyan to receive 100K due to the lockdown on corona’](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-false-news-of-ksh100000-payout-for-every-kenyan-during-covid-19-lockdown-not-broadcast-on-citizen-tv/)\n\n####
    Conspiracy theories and predictions\n\n“[Barack Obama is asking Africans not to
    accept vaccines that will come from America and Europe](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-former-us-president-obama-didnt-warn-africans-against-coronavirus-vaccines/)”.\n\n###
    Covid-19 disinformation in Kenya\n\nAfrica Check has looked at false information
    about Covid-19 mainly through the lens of disinformation, with content where the
    intent could be safely assessed as not meant to mislead or cause harm left out.
    Since March 2020 we have maintained an updated “[live guide](https://africacheck.org/reports/live-guide-all-our-coronavirus-fact-checks-in-one-place/)”,
    with decontextualized content — imagery and articles — forming the bulk of the
    entries for Kenya, for reasons discussed elsewhere in this report, key being the
    low barriers to entry. \n\n\n**Hoaxes**, fabricated content about non-existent
    events and entities, **half-truths,** where truths swim in the same waters as
    misleading claims, and **scams** with a financial motive are also key players
    in the Kenyan false information ecosystem. The prevalence of half-truths is especially
    effective — infusing false claims with plausible ones adds to the overall believability.
    \n\n**Cures and vaccines** are the next main types of pandemic disinformation.
    Many claims about cures come with a profit element in the background, such as
    buying a “natural” product or visiting a practitioner. Claims about vaccines are
    often caught up in the country’s strong conservative beliefs or protests about
    Africans being guinea pigs. \n\n### How false information about health in Kenya
    compares internationally\n\nLike in many other countries, the false health information
    that is shared in Kenya tends to be that which evokes emotional responses. But
    there are some differences.\n\nA lot of health mis- and disinformation in the
    Global North tends to be grounded in **ideology**, but there is little evidence
    of this in Kenya. This is a reason why harmful false information that is Kenya-specific
    originates on social and professional media, as opposed to, say, the anonymous
    web or conspiracy communities as is often the case elsewhere.\n\n**Relationships**
    also come before purpose in Kenya. Mis- and disinformation that taps into these
    networks — such as families and communities — is quite widely shared. \n\nFurther,
    due to how information leaches into the community (community meetings are crucibles
    for the individual to act on (false) information), disinformation often has more
    impact — for example a lot of stigma around Covid-19 patients has been experienced
    in Kenyan communities, sometimes with fatal outcomes. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe
    entire information ecosystem — government, the media, big tech, fact-checkers
    and audiences — has a role to play in countering health mis- and disinformation.
    \n\nBut there are some areas fact-checkers can look into:\n\n- Disinformation
    in particular in Kenya very often thrives by leveraging on **relationships**,
    because a lot of people have an emotional rather than rational or logical relationship
    to information. \n- **Indigenisation of fact-checking is important**: Our fact-checking
    work in 11 other African languages generated a lot of interest because it helps
    break accurate information out of the urban ivory towers where it is still very
    much concentrated. Others like the BBC have gone into localisation of content
    in much more detail<sup><a id=\"fnref15\" href=\"#fn15\">[15]</a></sup>.\n- More
    research into **how individual/societal differences such as culture affect responses
    to false** **health** **information** is needed. We need to better understand
    the circumstances that make fact-checking have any impact on politicians and how
    to make it a durable effect. How can we persuade the alcohol-peddling Nairobi
    governor to check himself?\n- Should we cloak up like mis/disinformation peddlers?
    For example, we know that adding an image to a tweet can make the difference between
    a fact-check that gets seen, and one that is outranked by more attention-grabbing
    posts. We’ve in the past debunked false health information with video, and we
    are already sending audio to our audiences. Should it be a standard? This is very
    much a point of debate<sup><a id=\"fnref16\" href=\"#fn16\">[16]</a></sup>."
