  body: "In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its
    epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world,
    and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and
    delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation
    were part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight
    three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in
    Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives
    by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around
    the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented
    and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.\n\n###
    Trust Crisis in Iran   \n\nIn the months leading up to the COVID-19 crisis in
    Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s official institutions. Following
    November 2019 protests that resulted in what is suspected to have been thousands
    of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the country’s wide-reaching military corps,
    and the (semi) elected Iranian government faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition,
    the downing and the subsequent coverup of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in
    January 2020 by the Guards led to a new round of protests ([Behravesh, Jan. 14,
    2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iran-plane-shoot-protest-crisis-competency-legitimacy-200113151404256.html)).\n\nAs
    COVID-19 began to take hold in the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei,
    President Rouhani, the Ministry of Health and other officials initially played
    down the pandemic, in fear that the virus  would lower voter turnout for the country’s
    February election (Al Jazeera, Feb. 23, 2020; [BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Less reported in the media are the other issues and events that have eroded public
    trust against these authorities throughout the pandemic: Channels affiliated to
    the Revolutionary Guards and state affiliated news channels promoted conspiracy
    theories about the virus’s origins. Masaf Institute for example, a  cultural and
    economic institution affiliated with Revolutionary Guard under the leadership
    of a well-known and cult-like conspiracy theorist, Ali Akbar Raefipour, stood
    out amongst these channels. They used their “health” Telegram channel called [@masaf_salam](https://t.me/masaf_salam)
    as well as it’s main channel [@masaf](https://t.me/masaf), to promote a wide range
    of conspiracies about the origins of the virus. Other accounts belonging or affiliated
    with the Revolutionary Guards such @afsaran_ir, @sepah_cyberi, @sepahcyberi were
    also actors promoting such theories. However, they further dramatized and promoted
    conspiracy theories that were being promoted in Iran’s official media regarding
    the virus as an attack by the US against Iran.\n"
