  description: In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found
    its epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the
    world, and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction
    and delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally.

  body: "In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its
    epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world,
    and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and
    delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation
    were part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight
    three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in
    Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives
    by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around
    the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented
    and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.\n\n###
    Trust Crisis in Iran   \n\nIn the months leading up to the COVID-19 crisis in
    Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s official institutions. Following
    November 2019 protests that resulted in what is suspected to have been thousands
    of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the country’s wide-reaching military corps,
    and the (semi) elected Iranian government faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition,
    the downing and the subsequent coverup of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in
    January 2020 by the Guards led to a new round of protests (Behravesh, Jan. 14,
    2020). "
