      In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

      Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

      ## Check in India

      In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

      In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

      The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

      ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

      Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

      In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months.

      ## Check in Indonesia

      In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

      Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

      > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

      ## Check in the Philippines

      The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

      The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
      “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

      In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

    body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
      misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
      content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
      since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
      published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election,
      to the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
      before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
      (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
      the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
      credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
      an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of
      it are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how
      to communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for
      content credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
      to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
      of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an
      initiative with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community
      group (CredWeb). [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
      (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
      to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
      documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
      to this issue.\n\n"

      Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

      ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

      We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

      ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

      Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

      ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

      With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

      ![“Aerial Photos of flooding caused by Hurricane Florence” by S.C. Air National Guard](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3FLP519tmwF4fE0nWhoYaB/0747fcb183e0af1ddabf57d2e4c086d8/1_WUPR5tVJFJ_Z-X9hEhkPFQ.jpeg)

      ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

      The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

      ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

      Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.

    body: "Misinfodemics, a term coined in 2018 by Meedan researchers, is a phenomenon
      in which online health misinformation contributes to the spread of real world
      disease. \n\nThe Lab’s [new report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf) notes
      that at both individual and population levels, low-quality online content about
      health topics can influence vaccination rates and herd immunity, the appropriate
      use of antibiotics and treatment regimens, the adoption of response efforts
      in epidemics, and access to care for serious illnesses. \n\nThe impact that
      this is having on population health suggests it is critical and urgent to re-think
      and innovate around the way we approach health misinformation.\n\n[Read the
      report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)."

  short_description: Collaborating with stakeholders in academia, policy, and civil
    society groups to develop clear pathways to responsible content moderation for
    technology platforms. Applied research with civil society organizations and human
    rights responders help us better understand varying experiences with content moderation
