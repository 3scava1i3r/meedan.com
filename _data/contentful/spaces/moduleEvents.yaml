      In this SPACE10 Session, Kala Sung from Kala’s Kimchi teaches us about the health benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting kimchi at home.

      ### This Week
      Korean kimchi is a lacto-fermented food, usually made from napa cabbage, Korean radish or other vegetables. There is growing evidence that fermented foods such as kimchi may improve intestinal health and as a result support the immune system and anti-inflammatory responses (Kok & Hutkins, 2018). Chef Kala Sung will show us how to make kimchi at home, while delving further into science behind the health benefits of fermented foods and kimchi in particular.

      ### About the Guest
      Kala ‘Kimchi Kueen’ Sung is a Korean New Yorker, an experienced and renowned chef and MA of Food Studies from NYU. Kala travels the world with her creative and culinary workshop, Kala’s Kimchi. She adapts traditional fermenting techniques to local produce and is continually introducing modern twists while retaining kimchi’s distinctive qualities.

      ### How to Attend
      This SPACE10 Session is hosted on Zoom. You can sign up by clicking the ‘Attend’ button below and submitting your name, email address, and location. From then on, just download Zoom so you’re ready to go — it should all take two minutes in total.

      On the day, be ready and logged in by 5pm so we can welcome all participants at once. But if you’re late, don’t worry — you can sneak in, we won’t tell anyone. When you enter the event, you will be muted to make the sonic experience as smooth as possible for all of us — but we hope you’ll drop an emoji or a greeting in the chat. And you may want to bring some questions for our guest!
