    long_description: "Meedan, in collaboration with Full Fact, Pesa Check, the University
      of Lagos and DataLEADS is hosting a session about effective responses to misinfodemics
      based on the latest behavior science research, how this research is put into
      practice, and the important role that fact-checking collaborations play. \n\n####
      Moderator\nNat Gyenes – Meedan, Director of Digital Health Lab\n\n#### Panelists\n-
      Dora-Olivia Vicol – Full Fact, Researcher\n- Eric Mugendi – Pesa Check, Maneging
      Editor\n- Ifeaoma Theresa Amobi – University of Lagos, Senior Lecturer\n- Syed
      Nazakat – DataLEADS, Founder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nThis session will review
      academic evidence from psychology and health communication to examine how we
      can tackle health misinformation. Tune in to learn more about (1) the psychology
      of crises, and why uncertainty diminishes the public’s ability to process information;
      (2) the spread of conspiracies, and why correcting anti-vaccination myths is
      so difficult; and (3) the social life of everyday health myths, and what we
      can do to tackle it with tact.\n\nTo learn more, visit [Global Fact's website](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/agenda/tackling-health-misinformation-with-truth-trust-and-tactics)."

    description: Text similarity algorithms can help fact-checkers locate misinformation,
      cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks when operating
      tip lines on end-to-end encrypted platforms.
    long_description: |-
      Misinformation about COVID-19 has led to severe harms in multiple instances: as an example, a rumor that drinking methanol would cure the virus resulted in hundreds of deaths. While end-to-end encryption is an important privacy safeguard, this encryption prevents platforms such as WhatsApp, Signal, and others from employing centralized interventions and warnings about misinformation. Several options, however, from user interface changes to tip lines to having more intelligence on client devices offer hope.

      In this presentation Dr Scott A. Hale will discuss how text similarity algorithms are being used to help fact-checkers locate misinformation, cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks in the context of tip lines on platforms with end-to-end encryption. The presentation will detail research at the Oxford Internet Institute and Meedan, a global technology not-for-profit developing open-source tools for fact-checking and translation, that is actively being used by fact-checkers to improve the information available online.

      The session will be a 30 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of questions. Dr Chico Camargo, Postdoctoral Researcher in Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, will moderate the session.

      **Dr Scott A. Hale** is a Senior Research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford; Director of Research at Meedan; and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His cross-disciplinary research develops and applies new techniques in the computational sciences to social science questions and puts the results into practice with industry and policy partners. He is particularly interested in mobilization/collective action, agenda setting, and antisocial behaviour (e.g., hate speech) and has a strong track record in building tools and teaching programmes that enable wider access to new methods and forms of data.

    description: Natural language processing and semantic change can help policymakers,
      public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep a finger on the
      pulse of the online health conversation.
    long_description: "We are in extraordinary times, but even prior to the pandemic
      thousands of health conversations were happening on social media everyday. In
      2019, Meedan's Digital Health Lab in collaboration with researchers at the Oxford
      Internet Institute, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and University
      of Michigan's Department of Computer Science developed and tested approaches
      to help policymakers, public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers
      keep a finger on the pulse of the online health conversation. By modifying semantic
      change detection methods, we found we could identify when health words were
      being used in new, unexpected ways. Many of these shifts were due to large external
      events, but a few were due to misinformation. \n\nThe research is [detailed
      in an 8-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzyr1e9tSJs&list=PLEcKYh_fjP9hsDdFjnRkxFdDKARmivAPg&index=13
      \"Presentation of the research on YouTube\") and will be discussed at Global
      Fact 7, the annual conference of the International Fact-Checking Network on
      Wednesday, June 24."
