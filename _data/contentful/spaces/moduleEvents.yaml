    description: 'A Check Global Network Event: Join us as we bring together 3 independent
      media organisations ensuring accessibility and diversity in their newsrooms
      while working in challenging regional contexts.'
    long_description: "Only when the cost of access to information is minimal in a
      country can it give way to diverse and vibrant voices of the citizenry. Yet,
      in many parts of the world, structural inequalities, opaque rules, lack of infrastructure
      and resistance from authorities stand in the way. To understand this systemic
      failure, it is important to break it down to a few key questions: Who seeks
      information? Who is denied information? Which information is hidden or does
      not exist? How costly and easy is the access?\n\nAs we observe the [International
      Day for Universal Access to Information](https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/accesstoinformationday)
      on September 28, it is important to acknowledge and learn from those who address
      these questions on a daily basis. To mark this day, Meedan is hosting an online
      event that brings together three innovative and independent newsrooms that are
      led by women, are editorially independent and are uncovering stories of public
      interest and importance in the emerging economies of Brazil, Egypt and India.\n\nThe
      ability to scrutinise, hold power to account and provide a platform for debate
      are roles that a free press and independent media can perform. Yet, governments
      in several countries are stifling criticism by attacking independent media organisations.
      These entities and media persons associated with them are at constant risk of
      being persecuted for their reporting, harassed for holding power to account
      and being starved of financial support. \n\nIn this context, we take a look
      at how [Al-Manassa](https://almanassa.com/en) (Egypt), [Fiquem Sabendo](https://fiquemsabendo.com.br/)
      (Brazil) and [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (India), three independent
      media organisations are able to:\nensure independence, plurality and diversity
      in their newsrooms while working in regions and contexts that are challenging\nbuild
      trust with audiences and innovate constantly\nprovide access to information
      for hard to reach communities\nbring a feminist voice and perspective to media
      content \n\nJoin us in a conversation with the women who lead these organisations
      — Nora Younis, Maria Vitoria Ramos and Disha Mullick — on September 28, 2020.
      \n\n### About the Speakers \n__Disha Mullick__ is the CEO of [Chambal Media](https://chambalmedia.com/),
      a company that produces media for rural audiences, with a unique rural feminist
      voice. Chambal Media runs the iconic news brand, Khabar Lahariya, where women
      from remote villages of north India are trained to be professional journalists
      and produce local news in their languages, from their unique perspective. \n\n__Maria
      Vitória Ramos__ is the co-founder and CEO of Fiquem Sabendo, a media startup
      in Brazil keeping the powerful accountable. She was a reporter for Ponte Jornalismo,
      exposing violations of Human Rights by the police and armed forces in Brazil
      and is the author of \"Indigentes: the State that buries without warning\",
      an investigative book that exposes the heartbreaking system that keeps families
      looking for supposedly missing people for years when they have been buried by
      the Brazilian government.\n\n__Nora Younis__ is the founder and chief editor
      of Al-Manassa, a news outlet in Egypt. A rights activist and journalist, Younis
      has also worked as managing editor at Al-Masry Al-Youm, a popular news daily
      in Egypt. Recently Younis was at the receiving end of the government clamping
      down on news organizations and was detained in the name of running a news website
      without an operating license. \n\nThis event is part of the Check Global Network’s
      series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’. Launched on May 5, 2020, Check Global
      Network members are currently located in the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan,
      Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mexico. As a community of
      independent media, technology and human rights groups, the Check Global Network
      plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges, to design collaborative
      projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners in emerging economies.\n\nFor
      more information about joining the network, please write to us at <a href=\"checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com\">checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com</a>
      with a statement of interest."
