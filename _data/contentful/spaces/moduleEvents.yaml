    description: Join veteran journalist and Rappler co-founder Maria Ressa in conversation
      with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist, to discuss reporting
      barriers during COVID-19. June 18 on Zoom.
    long_description: "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, free flow of reliable and independent
      information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However,
      with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people
      have limited access to independent information, and few spaces  to dialogue
      and discuss the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain
      the pandemic. This challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly
      complex and evolving information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers
      are expected to distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious
      disease.\n\nPeople need news and information they can trust. Instead of making
      this available, governments are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information
      and scrutinising voices that seek accountability. \n\nIn order to analyse and
      discuss potential solutions to the current misinfodemic, Meedan is hosting an
      online event titled, ‘Reporting Barriers During COVID-19. The session will have
      veteran journalist and co-founder of Rappler, Maria Ressa in conversation with
      Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist. Maria has been leading
      the fight for freedom of press in the Philippines. For her courage and work
      on disinformation, Maria was named Time Magazine’s 2018 Person of the Year,
      was among its 100 Most Influential People of 2019, and has also been named one
      of Time's Most Influential Women of the Century. Seema was a finalist for the
      Pulitzer Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning
      News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected diseases.\n\nLive

      About the Speakers\n\nA journalist in Asia for nearly 35 years, __Maria Ressa__
      co-founded Rappler, the top digital only news site that is leading the fight
      for press freedom in the Philippines. As Rappler's executive editor and CEO,
      Maria has endured constant political harassment and arrests by the Duterte government,
      forced to post bail eight times to stay free. Rappler's battle for truth and
      democracy is the subject of the 2020 Sundance Film Festival documentary, A Thousand
      Cuts. \n\nFor her courage and work on disinformation and 'fake news,' Maria
      was named Time Magazine’s 2018 Person of the Year, was among its 100 Most Influential
      People of 2019, and has also been named one of Time's Most Influential Women
      of the Century. She was also part of BBC's 100 most inspiring and influential
      women of 2019 and Prospect magazine's world's top 50 thinkers. Among many awards,
      she received the prestigious Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the World Association
      of Newspapers and News Publishers, the Knight International Journalism Award
      from the International Center for Journalists, the Gwen Ifill Press Freedom
      Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Shorenstein Journalism
      Award from Stanford University, the Columbia Journalism Award, the Free Media
      Pioneer Award from the International Press Institute, and the Sergei Magnitsky
      Award for Investigative Journalism. \n\nBefore founding Rappler, Maria focused
      on investigating terrorism in Southeast Asia. She opened and ran CNN's Manila
      Bureau for nearly a decade before opening the network's Jakarta Bureau, which
      she ran from 1995 to 2005. She wrote Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account
      of al-Qaeda’s Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia and From Bin Laden
      to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years of Terrorism.\n\n__Seema Yasmin__

      University of Cambridge.\n\nYasmin was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in
      breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning News and received
