      Press.
    long_description: |-
      Don’t read the comments. Old advice, yet more relevant than ever. The tools we once hailed for their power to connect people and spark creativity can also be hotbeds of hate, harassment, and political division. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are under fire for either too much or too little moderation. Creating and maintaining healthy online communities isn’t easy.

      Over the course of two years of graduate research at MIT, former tech journalist and current product manager Anika Gupta interviewed moderators who’d worked on the sidelines of gamer forums and in the quagmires of online news comments sections. She’s spoken with professional and volunteer moderators for communities like Pantsuit Nation, Nextdoor, World of Warcraft guilds, Reddit, and FetLife.

      [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) is the perfect book for anyone looking to take their small community group to the next level, start a career in online moderation, or tackle their own business’s comments section.

      Join [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) author Anika Gupta in conversation with [Memes to Movements](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567159/memes-to-movements-by-an-xiao-mina/) author An Xiao Mina about her new book, published by Tiller Press.

    long_description: "IntraHealth International is reimagining SwitchPoint 2020,
      a yearly global health, technology and innovation conference, in the wake of
      COVID-19. Instead of in-person global events, we’re launching a series of Virtual
      SwitchPoint Exchanges: online, creative, and highly interactive gatherings in
      the style of SwitchPoint.\n\nThe first Virtual SwitchPoint Exchange will take
      place September 18, 10am – 12:30pm EDT, in partnership with The Global Fund.
      Youth Voices: The Future We Want will amplify the voices of young global health
      leaders, including members of The Global Fund Youth Council, IntraHealth’s Family
      Planning Youth Ambassador team, young advocacy and policy leaders, and extraordinary
      artists such as Mikael Owunna, CJ Suitt, Culture Mill, and Kenyan acclaimed
      musical artist Juliani. The Global Fund CEO Peter Sands, IntraHealth International
      CEO Polly Dunford, and global specialists will join us as we focus on critical
      global health needs even as countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Registration
      is free and open, though attendance will be capped to keep each section of the
      event highly interactive. \n\nTwo members of the Meedan Digital Health Lab team,
      Nat Gyenes and Nour Sharara, will be hosting a Misinfodemics workshop. "
