      [As we've seen](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/using-misinformation-as-a-political-weapon-covid-19-and-bolsonaro-in-brazil/), health misinformation is escalating not only within Western democracies but also at a dangerous scale in emerging economies, where independent media workers and organizations have had to wade through financial, physical, and mental strain. As the Check Global team continued to monitor the ramifications of COVID-19 on emerging economies and independent media organizations, the need to act was undeniable.

      Meedan has engaged in a company-wide effort to address our partners' challenges, whether through building new technologies[ such as the COVID-19 Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/), providing independent newsrooms and partners with [a database led by expert epidemiologists and public health workers](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/) to facilitate fact-checking and verification initiatives, or contributing to [global research](https://meedan.com/blog/global-misinfodemic-report/) about COVID-19-related misinformation. In the interest of reaching out to new organizations in need, the Check Global team announced on April 8 a call to [support media organizations and media workers in Asia-Pacific, in Africa, in Latin America and in the North Africa Western Asia region through a series of micro-grants.](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/) The microgrants projects ranged amongst fact-checking projects, media literacy campaigns and daily blogging reflecting on applicants' quarantine realities. We were blown away by the popularity of our call, receiving a whooping 298 applications in less than 30 days!

      While overwhelming and heartening, the large pool of applications made the selection process challenging. A few criteria guided us in this process. Originality and the innovative nature of the application were  important factors in the selection. Some applications stood out for their creativity and clarity. Applications were also shortlisted on the basis of their achievability --- projects that proposed activities and outputs that could be realistically achieved during the current health crisis were prioritised. Finally, outreach and potential impact were also important factors. Projects that strengthened the involvement of underserved communities and represented issues of people in areas outside the radar of mainstream media made it to the final selection process. We had limited funding, but there are many applications that are deserving, and we hope to be able to support those projects at a later stage.

      In this round, we awarded 25 projects with funding that ranged between $300 and $2,500, for a total of $52,000. From organisations involved in relief work around COVID-19 to individuals committed to tracking the impact of the pandemic on local communities, - the range of applications was wide, rich and diverse. Given the work they do, some of these grantees face risks of political repression, and we're not able to list all of them here. Here are some of the highlights from our work:


      ### APAC: 7 Fact-checking projects targeting vulnerable groups

      We received close to 40 applications from the Asia Pacific region.

      We selected seven applications for media work have been selected from the APAC region for the COVID-19 microgrants. These represent six countries in the region, with a particular focus on Southeast and South Asia --- Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. The creation of online content that is fact-checked and accurate has been an area around which a few groups have designed their projects. [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/) has designed a project to create an online information hub in order to provide fact-checked information to citizens and civil society organisations. In the Philippines, we are thrilled to support the work of an individual, Carol Dawonlay/[Lalang Hu Mga Laga](https://www.facebook.com/pg/storiesofwomencampaign/posts/) who will produce social media cards and videos to highlight violence against women during the pandemic. [BASAbali](https://basabali.org/) in Indonesia is in the process of designing a digital literacy campaign around COVID-19 with the underserved and minority communities in Bali.

      We're also happy to support [Disability Empowerment Society Nepal](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/); they have designed a project to create an accessible website to provide news and information on COVID-19 to people with disabilities. In India, [Sadbhavana Trust](http://sadbhavanatrust.org.in/) will strengthen the leadership and meaningful participation of young women from underserved communities in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak by creating online content from a feminist perspective. [International Youth Alliance for Peace](https://iyapsl.org/) in Sri Lanka will design a  blogging project to capture stories of frontline workers addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

      ### Africa: 6 efforts curbing the ramifications of the COVID-19 misinfodemic

      We were thrilled by the 170 applications we received from Africa, which made up the majority of our overall application pool. Due to our limited funds we were only able to support six  applications from Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, Guinee, Tanzania, Zambia. Here are highlights from four of these.

      [People's Check](http://www.peoplescheck.org/) in Nigeria is launching the 'Verify Nigeria' project to fact-check and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that has affected people's health and life in Nigeria. People's Check will create different visual elements and participate in training students and citizen journalists on health fact-checking training. [Radio Daljir SOMALIA](https://www.daljir.com/) will support media literacy efforts in Somalia and design audio campaigns and radio reporting to bring health facts to the public, encourage COVID-19 prevention measures & make social distancing possible. Radio Daljir will target communities in Somalia's regions of Puntland and Galmudug States of Somalia with a focus on the situation of the nomads. [Zéro Pauvre Afrique (ZPA, "Zero Poor in Africa")](https://www.facebook.com/zeropauvreenafrique/) will track, deconstruct, disseminate misinfodemics with support of a network of volunteers in order to reduce their impact on the management of the COVID-19 crisis in Guinea.

      Family Welfare Foundation's project will contribute to ensuring engagement of human rights defenders and activists with local artists in documenting, information sharing, reporting and amplifying voices on injustice issues, human rights abuse and repressions associated to COVID-19 interventions in Tanzania.

      We are building on the success of the COVID-19 microgrants to create different media funds in Africa that can support more innovative projects.


      ### Latin America: Sustaining the work of 5 women-led independent media organizations

      We received 47 applications from Latin America in both Spanish and Portuguese. The majority of the 7 selected initiatives are led by women and are covering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in their regions. [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/) will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets in Cuba ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)) to increase regional awareness in matters related to the pandemic. Another fact checking initiative [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/) agency works and specializes in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com) a group of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With the theme "From my window" [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas ](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.GDezza.net) and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.

      ### NAWA: Supporting 5 investigations and fact-checking initiatives
      As for applications from the North Africa Western Asia region, we were lucky to receive 24 applications, both in English and Arabic.

      We are pleased and excited to support five projects from the region, divided between media literacy campaigns, fact-checking initiatives and in-depth investigations. [Radio Medenine](http://radiomedenine.com/), a community radio project based in southern Tunisia, aims to create a digital health program interviewing health experts and providing pressing health information. Award-winning collaborative blog [Nawaat](http://nawaat.org/portail/) ("the core" in Arabic), also from Tunisia, will be sustaining its trilingual fact-checking efforts through our grant over the next month, while media platform [SyriaUntold](https://syriauntold.com/en/) will publish a series of investigative reports about health disparities in Syria. We were also happy to fund an investigation on the state of African refugees in Tangier and a health fact-checking campaign in Egypt.

      The above COVID-19 microgrants recipients have given Meedan consent to announce their projects publicly, while others have not been named for security reasons.

    body: "Last night we learned that our friend and Meedan Board of Directors member
      Maria Ressa has been convicted of cyber libel and sentenced to serve time in
      prison for these crimes. Here is a quick run-down of the verdict and case details:\n\n-
      On Monday, June 15, Manila Regional Trial Court Judge Rainelda Estacio Montesa
      convicted Rappler CEO and Executive Editor Maria Ressa and former researcher-writer
      Rey Santos Jr of cyber libel. \n- The court sentenced Ressa and Santos to a
      minimum of six months and one day to a maximum of six years in prison.\n- They
      were released on bail pending appeal. Ressa and Santos were also each ordered
      to pay 200,000 Philippine pesos (approximately 3,500 euros) in moral damages
      and 200,000 pesos in exemplary damages.\n- Ressa and Reynaldo will not go to
      prison at this time, as the conviction can be appealed and they have the option
      to exhaust legal remedies in higher courts. \n- The cyber-libel case against
      Ressa is based on an investigative report published by Rappler on May 2012.
      \n- The article said that the then-chief justice of the Philippines Supreme
      Court, Renato Corona, had used vehicles belonging to a controversial businessman.\n-
      The article was republished on February 2014, to correct a spelling error, which
      is a normal practice of news publications.\n- In February last year, the Department
      of Justice (DOJ) arrested Ressa and filed charges against her, reporter Reynaldo
      Santos Jr. and Rappler Inc. under the Cybercrime Prevention Act, which was enacted
      on September 2012, four months after the publication of the original report
      in Rappler. \n- The charges stemmed from a complaint by the businessman, Wilfredo
      D. Keng. Authorities initially declined to prosecute the case, but later reversed
      that decision.\n- In the court, the prosecution argued that the republication
      of the article in 2014 to correct a “typo” amounted to republication of the
      story and therefore the cyber libel law could be applied.\nSource: [International
      Press Institute](https://ipi.media/maria-ressa-fearless-journalism-found-guilty/?mc_cid=a0dd6d7110&mc_eid=89968079c7)&
      [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/263817-statement-conviction-maria-ressa-reynaldo-santos-jr-cyber-libel-case)\n\nAcross
      the interwebs there is an outpouring of support for Maria and condemnation of
      this verdict. We add to that our emphatic support for Maria, for Rappler's meticulous
      and ethical journalism, and for the very institution of an open and critical
      press that she has come to embody. \n\nI want to share some personal reflections,
      some context, that might not be known to an international audience who sees
      her only as the Time Magazine person of the year and a global face of press
      freedom. The Maria Ressa I have come to know is most remarkable for the fact
      that she has built a media property to oppose and stand against corruption,
      violence, and censorship while remaining one of the kindest, most modest, and
      upbeat people I have ever encountered. This is not a veneer - it goes straight
      through to the core of who Maria is.  \n\nAnd then there is the way Maria thinks.
      Anyone who has ever been involved in a project with Maria knows what happens
      after the glimmer in her eye sparks and she pushes up in her chair and begins
      tossing out ideas and connecting dots. The way Maria thinks is somewhere between
      a journalist, a moral philosopher, a web application designer, and a database
      architect. Two weeks ago we had a meeting with Maria and her team to discuss
      rolling out some journalism technology with her team. Within five minutes Maria
      has sprinted past what any of us had envisioned - basically laying out a roadmap
      for the reinvention of journalism in the age of messaging networks and on demand
      information services.  \n\nThere is something deep in the notion of social justice.
      It is  that there is a definable justice that sits beneath courts and laws,
      a justice that is 'social' in the sense that it is what society knows to be
      true. Maria has been fighting for social justice in the Philippines for decades
      by simply documenting the truth in that society. And now the powers that are
      threatened by that truth are corrupting their courts and laws to preserve their
      ability to control what can be said by whom. This is not only a threat to our
      dear friend Maria and her colleague Rey, it is more profoundly a threat to journalism
      *and* democracy in the Philippines and around the world. \n\n\nPlease join us
      in raising your voice in support. #holdtheline #standwithmaria #supportrappler
      \n\n---\n\n*Meedan's Check Global Network invites you to attend our upcoming
      online event on June 18: [Maria Ressa and Seema Yasmin in Conversation: Reporting

    body: "To wake up in Brazil in 2020 is to confront daily headlines that send us
      back to 1968, our years of military dictatorship. We see headlines such as:
      Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro [suspends](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/07/bolsonaro-removes-surging-coronavirus-death-toll-official-websites/
      \"Bolsonaro removes number of deaths\") publication of number of deaths; the
      government demands a [recount](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/governo-vai-recontar-numero-de-mortos-por-covid-19-diz-secretario-da-saude.shtml
      \"Bolsonaro's govenament wants to recount the number of deaths \") of the death
      numbers saying they are \"inflated\". Meanwhile Brazilian scientists estimate
      that the number of underreported victims of COVID-19 is [seven times higher](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/numero-de-casos-de-covid-19-no-brasil-pode-ser-ate-sete-vezes-maior-do-que-oficial-diz-pesquisa-1-24445874
      \"Number of deaths can be seven times higher than the official numbers, says
      research\") than what has been reported. This means that according to the [official
      data](https://www.publico.pt/2020/06/05/mundo/noticia/brasil-morre-pessoa-minuto-devido-covid19-1919572
      \"According to offcial data one person dies per minute due to covid-19 in Brazil\"),every
      minute, a person dies from COVID-19 in Brazil. \n\nIn Latin America the erasure
      of data and memory, lack of transparency and the rise of scientific and [historical](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml
      \"Bolsonaro denies the existance of Brazil's military dictatorship past\") denialism
      is nothing new, much less in Brazil. For a [brief period ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/referencia-global-sobre-covid-19-universidade-johns-hopkins-interrompe-contagem-de-dados-do-brasil-1-24466845?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=O%20Globo
      \"Johns Hopkins University interrupts feed of Brazil COVID-19 data\")of time
      this week, Brazil was removed from the Johns Hopkins University ranking that
      globally counts the number of victims of the pandemic. This was a result of
      the decision taken on June 2nd by Bolsonaro to [take down](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/governo-esconde-totais-de-mortes-casos-da-covid-19-tira-site-do-ar-1-24466314
      \"Brazillian governament takes down COVID-19 death numbers from official website\")
      the website that provides data on deaths by COVID-19 in the country. Upon making
      them available again this Friday, the government decided that it would focus
      on the number of [victims recovered ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/portal-da-covid-19-volta-ao-ar-mas-sem-total-de-casos-mortes-sem-planilha-com-dados-detalhados-1-24466899
      \"Offcial Helath portal comes back with data without the numbers breakdown\")and
      those who have died in the past 24 hours. A breakdown of the data by region,
      and by total number of deaths will no longer be available. \n\nThe government
      also decided to recount the dead and check the math as it believes the numbers
      were [\"made up\"](https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/bela-megale/post/ministerio-da-saude-vai-recontar-mortos-pela-covid-19-porque-diz-ver-dados-fantasiosos.html
      \"Governament wants to recount the numbers saying they are made up\"). It is
      not the first time that this government has questioned the data provided by
      scientific organizations. In July 2019, when asked about the exponential growth
      of deforestation in the Amazon,the Chief Minister of the Institutional Security
      Office, General Augusto Heleno, said that the data was [\"manipulated\"](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/indices-de-desmatamento-na-amazonia-sao-manipulados-diz-ministro-augusto-heleno.shtml
      \"Minister Augusto Heleno says Amazon deforestation data was manipulated\")
      by the National Institute for Space Research (INSPE). More recently, this scientific
      denialism has manifested in the firing of the Women's Health Coordination Team
      at the Ministry of Health, due to the publication of a technical note that addresses
      access to sexual and reproductive health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Several organizations [denounced](http://www.visibilidadefeminina.org/noticias
      \"Visibilidade Feminina website\") this decision, among them Visibilidade Feminina
      (Feminine Visibility), a non-profit civil organization that aims to promote
      the role of women in public and private spaces of power.\n\nThe majority of
      the victims in the COVID-19 pandemic are black, according to a survey by [Agência
      Pública](https://apublica.org/2020/05/em-duas-semanas-numero-de-negros-mortos-por-coronavirus-e-cinco-vezes-maior-no-brasil/
      \"In two weeks the number of black vistims is five times higher\"), and they
      are victims of a racist and genocidal policy imposed by the Bolsonaro government
      which [plays down the effects of the pandemic](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/23/americas/brazil-coronavirus-hospitals-intl/index.html
      \"CNN article on Brazil hospitals\"). The number of black victims with low literacy
      is four times higher than that of white people with a higher education level,
      as revealed by the [research carried](http://www.ctc.puc-rio.br/diferencas-sociais-confirmam-que-pretos-e-pardos-morrem-mais-de-covid-19-do-que-brancos-segundo-nt11-do-nois/
      \"Research says that more black people die due to COVID-19\") out by PUC-RIO.
      And this week we also learned that the virus is [twice as lethal](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-humanos/noticia/2020-06/covid-19-agrava-violacoes-contra-indigenas-yanomami-diz-estudo

      through today, generates [trauma](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30408012
      \"Moment of Truth for Brazil's military past\") in the fabric of society that
      needs to be repaired to avoid a repeat of our recent past, where there has been
      an erasure of popular history of collective resistance. After the transitional
      justice process post-dictartorship was done we did not, for example, [hold the
      military to account](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2019-01-01/ghosts-brazils-military-dictatorship
      \"Ghosts of Brazil's military dictatorship\").\n\nOne lesson we did learn was
      the importance of memory as a practice of resistance. By preserving historical
      artifacts such as testimonies, documents, images and videos during and after
      the dictatorship period we were able, more or less effectively, to carry out
      recovery processes through the [National Commission of Truth](https://www.conectas.org/en/news/final-report-of-the-national-truth-commission-what-now-brazil
      \"Final Report of the national truth comission\") that addressed missing persons,
      the exiled and victims of political crimes. After the dictatorship, the Brazilian
      Constitution of 1988 sought to heal some secular wounds as a result of the efforts
      of civil society that demanded the creation of SUS, our universal health system
      which provides access to health for the Brazilian population. It is this same
      system that during the COVID-19 pandemic is collapsing in several states of
      the country, proving that it is [underfunded](https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/o-sus-e-o-direito-a-saude-em-tempos-de-coronavirus/
      \"About SUS and the constitucional right to acess health\"), even while being
      essential.\n\nThe cruelty of this historical moment becomes acute, when, in
      addition to burying our dead in [collective graves](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-brazil-mass-graves-experts-anticipate-covid-19-deaths-2020-5
      \"Photos of Brazil mass graves\"), remembering their lives, and surviving a
      pandemic, we still urgently need to preserve data and documents, in order for
      compensation to be possible in the future to the families of the victims of
      this policy. \n\n\n### Acting while we suffer: online collective mourning and
      self-organizing \n\nMemory as resistance is being articulated by the [Memorial
      of Victims of COVID-19 in Brazil](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
      \"Facebook page of the covid-19 memorial\"), a Facebook page that aims to honor
      victims and tell their stories. And it is one of the initiatives of the [Support
      Network for the Families of Fatal Victims of Covid-19 in Brazil](https://seguraaonda.com.br/nasce-a-rede-de-apoio-as-familias-de-vitimas-fatais-do-covid-19-no-brasil/),
      an emergency network made up of volunteers, professionals and people in solidarity
      with the families of victims in the country, in their honor. The network's objectives
      are to: provide guidance for funerals, burials and farewell rituals and to create
      channels to guarantee the right to memory and wakes (even if virtual) and due
      tribute to the dead. \n\nNews portal [G1](http://especiais.g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/memorial-vitimas-covid-19/#/
      \"G1 COVID-19 omline Memorial\"), has responded to this collective need of mourning
      by creating an online memorial with the victim's obituaries. Another example
      is [Inumeráveis ](https://inumeraveis.com.br/ \"Inumeráveis website\")(Innumerable)
      a collaborative and volunteer virtual memorial effort with the premise that
      no one likes to be a number, according to them, people deserve to exist in prose.
      Their editorial process involves families of the victims, journalists and researchers.
      It was built as a space to celebrate life.\n\nTo articulate how self organizing
      is important for the indigenous population in Brazil in challenging the state
      narrative you only have to compare the numbers of confirmed deaths recorded
      by families and communities with the official numbers that the government shares
      from the Special Indigenous Health Secretariat (Sesai). In some cases they are
      [three times](https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2020/06/01/18-mil-indigenas-sao-infectados-por-covid-19-em-78-povos-no-brasil-diz-organizacao.ghtml
      \"Numbers of infected indigenous population\") higher according to Articulation
      of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil (Apib) their aim is to preserve victims’ memory.\n\n\n###
      Preserving memory as a path forward\n\n> \"Memory is, in itself, an end, a strategy
      to repair the damage caused to human rights and is a way to reconcile a society\"
      comments Professor Isabel Piper Shafir, from the Faculty of Social Sciences
      at the University of Chile, about the post-dictatorship reparation processes
      in Chile. \n\nTo ensure that we can use memory as a strategy for reparation,
      the work of civil organizations, activists, technologists, historians, researchers
      and journalists is essential to the archiving and preservation process. \n\nUnderstanding
      our current information ecosystem can be part of the strategy for the sustainability
      of these archives and collections of data. The memorial of the Covid-19 victims
      in Brazil is hosted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
      \"Facebook page of the Memorial for Victms of COVID-19 in Brazil\")'s platform;
      in practical terms this means that the content, those collectively woven threads
      of memory, are being stored and held by a corporate social media platform. These
      corporations are becoming the record keepers of a country's history while there
      is still a [total lack of transparency](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/facebook-instagram-lack-transparency-government-ordered-content-removal-amid
      \"EFF: Facebook and Instagram lack transparency\") regarding their content moderation
      policies. Often we don't know why they take something down, leaving their motivation
      unclear and leaving us to wonder: was this content [censored](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive
      \"Instagram shadow bans marginalised communities\")? Was it a technical error?
      Or did it infringe the platform's policies?\n\nA possible response is using
      open source technology to contribute to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard
      content and history, helping to preserve context and ownership, as well as ensuring
      data collection and transparency for future accountability. \n\nThere are several
      formats of how civil organizations and open source communities can cooperate
      in these efforts some examples are: creating open source investigations to collect
      data on the victims of COVID-19 using [Check](https://meedan.com/check \"Check
      - Meedan website\"), or using archiving software such as Huridoc's [Uwazi ](https://www.uwazi.io/
      \"Uwazi website\")to curate and publish human rights documentation that could
      make important, public information more accessible, as well as using the OpenArchive’s
      [app Save](https://open-archive.org/save/ \"Save website\") to streamline media
      workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting while encrypting the media.
      Another open source approach comes from [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/ \"DocNow
      website\") whose focus is on archiving social media activist content, they do
      this by engaging directly with communities and [co-creating](https://news.docnow.io/documenting-activism-now-17db7b956fcf
      \"DocNow blog post on Documenting Activism\") through workshops solutions that
      are customized to their needs and workflows. \n\nLet's learn from our past historical
      erasures and organize ourselves to use current technology to safeguard our memory
      but also to understand the limitations of certain tools and products. Perhaps
      this time around, we can say that in spite of our collective shock and loss
      we honored our loved ones by mourning, remembering and saving space for future
      reparation. And hopefully as we walk on the coronavirus-free streets again we
      will do it in spaces that, different from today, are liberated of rotting statues
      and avenues named after the generals that were responsible for digging mass
      graves in times past. \n"

    body: "All injustices have at their core an abuse of power. Systemic injustices
      ingrain these abuses into the structure of our societies, into the mechanics
      of how power, money, opportunity, and—as the past months have made so brutally
      apparent—health is accessed and distributed. \n\nAs an organization that is
      ultimately built on the premise that truth and knowledge are contextual, we
      have an obligation to the truth that exceeds our commitment to non-partisanship.
      We in the strongest possible terms condemn the killings of George Floyd and
      Breonna Taylor, and we criticize US national leadership, whose lack of contrition
      and unwillingness or inability to empathize with the very clear sentiments of
      millions of Americans in this moment is a profound and damaging failure.\n\nMeedan,
      while founded in the US, is a global technology non-profit working with media
      partners around the world, primarily in the global south. Our partners work
      to document human rights abuses in Yemen, uncover political corruption in the
      Philippines, and empower young investigative journalists and fact-checkers in
      Africa. We have designed our organization in response to the single question:
      \"What can we do as engineers, program managers, researchers and designers to
      address injustice and inequity in digital spaces?\"\n\nThis moment of social
      rage is of profound concern. We must demand more of our institutions and of
      our leaders, especially with regards to systemic racism against Black communities.
      Every sector of our society from the institutions of our government, to our
      corporations, to the media, to our universities, to the technology platforms,
      to organizations like ours must make an aggressively anti-racist approach core
      to our business models, our missions and our daily work.\n\nAt Meedan we commit
      to honoring the memory of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and all those whose
      lives and livelihoods have been harmed by anti-blackness, racism, hatred and
      disinformation. So much more needs to be done, and we commit to using our work---our
      tools, our programs, and our research---to helping in this effort.\n\n\n— Ed
      Bice, CEO, Meedan\n\n"
