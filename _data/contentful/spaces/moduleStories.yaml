      url: "//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/BFv04cYmlzazIO8In6HIC/ebc81119f6ddc371e9d5c1747c6c2c3b/Meedan_covid-19_database.png"
    body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
      massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
      support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
      researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
      a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
      and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
      infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material
      for journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize
      pandemic-related information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can
      present a bottleneck for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies,
      when demand for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the
      Harvard School of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have
      been researching how health information inequity and digital health misinformation
      can impact the spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps
      that can exacerbate those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care.
      \n\nIt is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic,
      that two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
      and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
      health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research
      and epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious
      disease researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively
      to a wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
      is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
      CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
      and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
      — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the
      second challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is
      supplying important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan
      to utilize ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate
      can be shared readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database
      into fact-checking bot workflows that many of our partners are already using
      to source questions from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to
      either access existing resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries
      to be fact-checked. This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations
      directly, and providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable
      initiatives being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health
      ministries around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality
      information through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative,
      Twitter, Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency
      and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered
      around six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access
      to experts can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities
      to access reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is
      populated and regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly
      sourced questions and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental
      health organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs
      during the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global
      network of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain
      the database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers
      and communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
      COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
      public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
      required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue
      to collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies
      and evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact
      assessment, monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design.
      In addition to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate
      to be working with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City
      University, as well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the
      behavioral impact of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database
      priorities and content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist
      COVID-19 response effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative
      \ to bridge research and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators.
      We are developing templates for packaged, verified content that can be included
      in outputs sent from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded
      in behavior science and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of
      care for communications, and include best practices for addressing health information
      response challenges, such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and
      transparency in the ever-changing information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__
      We are prioritizing pathways for disseminating contents of the database across
      languages to fact-checkers and pandemic communicators around the world. We are
      also integrating into Meedan’s open source verification and fact-checking workspace
      software, Check, in order to make its expert-reviewed contents available to
      the public. Through Check, we are creating an interface for users to design
      custom multilingual bots for disseminating their fact-checked content, connecting
      users to closed messaging networks including Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct
      Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then be able to access a subset of relevant
      resources, selected by each fact-checking organization individually, via a simple
      query system, and will be presented with short lists of up-to-date content that
      matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__ Through this project, we are examining
      the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions across languages and geographies,
      exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation, and translating findings
      into useful insights for public health communicators. In addition, as a group
      that works closely with partners in emerging economies, Meedan is closely following
      the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people living in densely populated
      urban areas and underserved communities that don't have access to public health
      care systems. Our team members in different regions are tracking the impact
      of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence against women, and insights
      will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. During this historic
      time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical questions about
      everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious disease research.
      Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer questions about
      complex health information, medical research and epidemiological findings, while
      public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers struggle to urgently
      communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The result of this problem
      set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor health outcomes,
      as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world spread of
      disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure on fact-checking
      organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience to health
      experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including research
      on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and the
      Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
      Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped
      much of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of
      Meedan’s Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal
      of promoting health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six
      years, these ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night
      dinners and graduate school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu
      brainstorming, in sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival,
      the Digital Health @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News
      Initiative Summits, in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics,
      mixed methods, and human rights lectures, and in conversations between friends
      and colleagues, hopeful in our ability to create something important together.
      I am immensely grateful to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make
      the most of our work together, and to all of our supporters as we further develop
      this intersection.\n\nThis COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without
      the partnership and collaboration of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural
      Insights Team, Birmingham City University, students and researchers from the
      Harvard School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
      and our network of public health specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this
      initiative, we are keen to learn and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity
      to contribute to the challenging and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators
      are doing to address this pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please
      reach out at health@meedan.com to talk more.\n"

    body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives
      is one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
      with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
      and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
      expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
      information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
      health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
      fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and
      time at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This
      ensures that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time.
      Including specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization
      hosts daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries
      may change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the
      exact point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2.
      Be context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
      For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
      about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
      to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only.
      This ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
      and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular
      treatments have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information
      you use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information
      you have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed
      to publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
      such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
      This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
      information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
      with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
      a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
      to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
      our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
      health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
      is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
      and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
      a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
      for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
      Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical
      recommendations to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with
      that. If there are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants
      answered, they can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:
      \ \n\n>   “If you're looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare
      provider, and   be sure to review the World Health Organization website for
      more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs
      the COVID-19 pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents
      and screens, drastically impacting public health, our way of life and global
      markets, Meedan is also reflecting on this historic moment and its emerging
      lessons: In the coming weeks we will be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19,
      written by journalists, fact-checkers, censorship experts, thought leaders and
      academics. The contributors are writing about the pandemic through the fog of
      the war— filing reports and analyses as news is still breaking, long before
      we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe analyses will aim to shine a
      light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship, localization of information
      access, and public trust, as we start to think about moving forward and away
      from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this in our newsletter and
      on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
      The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should
      not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized
      for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection
      is possible\"\n\n"

    body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
      of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
      ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
      to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso,
      and Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with
      newsrooms, fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three
      continents.\n\nThis represents significant growth from previous years, allowing
      us to deepen our support for these regions with program leads who are deeply
      familiar with their local contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our
      amazing partners around the world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional
      leads, along with Wafaa Heikal, our long-running program manager who is now
      heading up our efforts in Africa and the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini
      Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi is passionate about feminism and local journalism.
      Over the last two decades, her work has brought the two together. Shalini has
      studied misinformation, particularly on closed messaging platforms. She has
      been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/)
      ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)). The fellowship focused on designing creative
      ways to counter misinformation. As a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/),
      ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/)
      - a research project focused on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini
      started her professional journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/),
      a centre for gender education. She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented
      communities to come into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes.
      Shalini is the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/)
      (“News Waves” in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya
      is known for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women
      from some of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project
      is a testament to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent
      media is essential, as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini
      believes that [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can
      be a turning point for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation
      shared on closed messaging platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate,
      annotate, verify and archive misinformation and Shalini believes that for several
      small and independent newsrooms, this is a great service that no other platform
      currently provides. Check has tremendous potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers
      to design collaborative projects, especially around areas of common interest.
      Its unique features are great for large projects on politics, health, climate
      change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n### Meet Isabella Barroso
      in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa, is Meedan's Latin
      America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms in both Spanish
      and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's program team
      with a passion for human-centred design and product development that is fit
      to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design, Isa
      hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills in
      product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
      journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
      [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
      and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am
      now developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\"
      noted Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned
      a lot about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this
      happens with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America
      seems to be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging
      on closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
      overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
      Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in
      journalism. She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy
      to literature. \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with
      culture and social media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first
      job was as a culture journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
      due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
      came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
      of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
      I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
      open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
      the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
      media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
      with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news
      cycle. In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor
      and verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human
      rights researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
      annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
      open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support
      different workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate
      and what context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work
      across an interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with
      small teams and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring
      projects, understanding the particular national context and partner capacities
      and then designing new workflows around them.”\n\n"

    body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work
      remotely most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity
      for journalists, fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of
      COVID–19, the novel coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences
      focusing on Internet freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      the project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
      from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
      Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in
      COVID-19-related content, and  public health and science communication experts
      have been helping us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to
      ensure  accurate information can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate
      health information usually spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities
      at risk, but this year it’s more critical for us to accomplish what we usually
      do at conferences. While we are disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues
      in person, there’s an opportunity here. There have always been many reasons
      to have a virtual conference, but now there are more people and organizations
      motivated to do something about it - there are entire industries going virtual.
      At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity and inclusion amongst both staff
      and partners. If we work on this issue during a pandemic, we can make conferences
      more accessible for everyone as a long term goal too. Participants from emerging
      economies often have difficulty getting visas to attend conferences. Global
      climate change has led several people to forgo airplane travel. Parents have
      to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some disabilities make travel
      difficult, and the disability activism community has long called for improvements
      to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote participation has been used
      by several conferences to enable attendance for people who cannot travel. While
      this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual conferences are not widespread,
      and they lack virtual versions of useful conference activities. Many of the
      open source tools we use were designed by covering walls in a massive number
      of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What do you need from
      a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions? What works for
      you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe started with
      the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2. Presenting
      product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5. One-on-one
      discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7. Un-conference
      formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe came up
      with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked at
      were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
      budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
      high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
      indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
      thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
      has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a
      disability, however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is
      not an option at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling.
      As long as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate
      with other participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant
      lives in a region or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection.
      Any virtual conference technology has to take low bandwidth environments into
      account.\n\n3. This participant has a passport or legal status that makes it
      difficult for them to travel. They often get rejected for visas, even when they
      are a featured speaker at a conference. \n\n3. This participant lives in a country
      that censors the Internet and arrests journalists. In order to participate safely,
      they can only go to conferences with a no photo or video policy, whether this
      is a blanket ban or attendee preferences can be signaled by the color of their
      conference lanyard. Any virtual conference technology must allow private access,
      allowances for pseudonyms, participation without voice or video, and possibly
      compatibility with censorship circumvention technologies.\n\n4. This participant
      is Deaf. Their technology needs may include live captioning, participation by
      typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video of presenters to enable lip
      reading, or clear audio from participants depending on their level of hearing
      and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant is blind. Virtual
      conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers, and presenters
      should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of their presentation
      materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems understanding
      one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation, or
      just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
      participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the
      presentation. They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the
      ability to ask questions of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who
      need mobility aids face obstacles when traveling. Wheelchair users often get
      broken chairs back from airlines. When these chairs are custom fit, there are
      no temporary replacements that can make participating in a conference a pain-free
      experience. Power wheelchairs are very expensive, so travel can mean gambling
      with one’s mobility for a long time after a conference. \n\n9. This participant
      has modest tech skills and may need help with operating the interface for online
      meetings. Usability is an access issue. \n\nWe’re working with our communities
      to make lasting change out of this emergency situation. The civic tech community
      is evaluating software and practices for conferences and hackathons. We’re also
      expanding our online developer community. Let’s build something together! \n\nEmail
      us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a> to get started. "

    body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
      of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
      is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a
      global challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training
      sessions, host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and
      have network partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people,
      crossing borders, gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly
      global collaboration to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a
      global anti(in-person)-gathering. In Meedan terms: the future of our global
      town squares is dependent on our near term efforts to keep our physical town
      squares empty, and our digital town squares free of dangerous misinformation.
      \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic we are addressing the
      immediate needs of a global team and also working to develop programs that contribute
      to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing the lead of some other [inspiring
      organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
      \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and
      personal paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose
      school has been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members.
      We have closed our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have
      put a hold on the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.
      \  \n\nLast week we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support
      for their health and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans,
      budgets, and project timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent
      and encouragement of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development
      Cooperation Agency.  \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses.
      Last year we launched the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to
      health information as a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and
      Nat Gyenes framed some of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient
      piece in the Atlantic, [How Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
      \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous
      international bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable
      areas for civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with
      epidemiologists, public health communications experts, technology companies,
      and civil society partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository
      of annotated misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of
      our Check Global, Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies
      into this new program area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible
      threat to our emotional and physical well-being, I want to close this brief
      statement by saying perhaps this global project to stay apart might actually
      serve to bring together a world that is riven politically and ideologically.
      It’s going to take some brilliant and heroic collaborations to make it through
      the next several months and we are committed to doing what we can as an organization
      placed at the epicenter of misinformation response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist?
      Public Health Expert? Talented Engineer? [Post-doc Researcher](https://meedan.com/jobs/research-fellow/
      \"Meedan Job Posting\")? Email us at hello@meedan.com if you want to lend a
      hand with the formidable task of getting high quality COVID-19 info onto the
      interwebs while we rebuild this plane inflight and work through a new way of
      running a coronavirus resistant organization.\n\nEAB<br/>\nMarch 16, 2020<br/>\nWoodacre,

    body: "As the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic
      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus. This is particularly challenging for civil society
      organisations and grassroots collectives who are still struggling to make sense
      of, and to counter the effects of, the outbreak on their own local contexts.
      \n\nIn an attempt to support independent media, fact-checkers, citizen journalists,
      activists, and technology and digital literacy enthusiasts in their efforts
      to cover the outbreak, Meedan is launching the COVID-19 Check Global micro grants,
      specifically aimed at groups working within the context of evolving economies
      (Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Africa, Latin America, Asia-Pacific region).
      \n\nThe grants are aimed at supporting fact-checking and verification projects,
      local watchdog initiatives, documentation of local reality under quarantine
      and media/digital literacy campaigns, tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies,
      and examining digital surveillance and surveillance capitalism, civil rights,
      and violence against women related to COVID-19. We encourage applicants to be
      creative in their proposals. We  are keen to support the production of different
      kinds of outputs, including podcasts, videos, documentaries, written pieces,
      campaigns, toolkits, digital archives, and blogging. We are also looking to
      support proposals that are not only focused on covering misinformation about
      the pandemic, but also looking at people's lives and experiences under quarantine.\n\nWe
      are accepting proposals in English, Arabic, French, Spanish and Portuguese at
      the moment. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis. \n\n\n- Individuals
      can apply for up to $500 \n- Organizations can apply for up to $2000\n- Collaborative
      projects can apply for up to $2500 \n\n\n__Application process__\n\n\n1. Applicants
      should fill out an [online form](https://forms.gle/BL9wbZwJZqq8DWtE7) detailing
      their proposal \n2. The fund advisory board meets weekly to review all applications\n3.
      Successful applicants are then notified within a period of 5 to 10 days from
      submission\n\n\n__Selection criteria__\n- Originality & significance: The quality
      of the written application. What are the challenges it suggests to address?
      What is its geographic area / focus?\n- Achievability: Will the applicant be
      able to deliver on the promises made in the application? Is the work plan realistic
      within the suggested timeline? Does the fieldwork represent any ethical or health
      and safety issues that need to be taken into consideration? \n- Impact & Dissemination:
      Does the application identify a relevant audience for the work? How does the
      work set out to transform perception on COVID-19? Is the application clear in
      terms of why this work is important now? Projects that serve local and underserved
      communities, women, gender non-binaries, vulnerable people and rural populations
      will be prioritized.\n- Rigour: Do you adhere to a fact-checking methodology?
      How will the applicant check their sources as accurate? Are the resources used
      for your media literacy campaign reliable?\n\nPlease be advised, if you haven’t
      heard from us within 3 weeks of your application, this means it was not successful.
      Unfortunately we are not able to respond to each unsuccessful applicant due
      to the numbers of applications we receive.\n\nAccepted applicants will publish
      their projects on their own platforms and will be referenced on the Check Global
      page. They will later be highlighted on our blog at the end of this funding
      cycle. \n\n__[Apply Here](https://forms.gle/BL9wbZwJZqq8DWtE7)__\n\n__Check
      Global__ is an initiative  from Meedan that supports and facilitates journalism
      and human rights work, including research, in developing countries. We provide
      software, training, and support to a group of independent media organizations,
      journalism schools, and human rights researchers in Latin America, East Africa
      and the NAWA region. \n\n__Meedan__ is a non-profit that focuses on improving
      the quality and equity of online information. We do this by building software
      and designing human-powered initiatives for newsrooms, NGOs and academic institutions."
