    body: "In July 2018, I traveled to Zimbabwe to join The Carter Center to work
      with civil society organizations and newsrooms on tracking and addressing misinformation
      around the first harmonized elections in the country after Robert Mugabe stepped
      down.\n\nWhen I arrived in Zimbabwe, election-related propaganda was all over
      news media and social media. As an Egyptian, I was all too familiar with this
      kind of information ecosystem: mainstream media is owned by the state, and its
      goal is simply to amplify and spread one side of the story — that of those in
      power. Wandering the streets of Harare, it was impossible not to notice the
      dominance of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front
      ([Zanu-PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU%E2%80%93PF)) in its use of posters
      and billboards. Zimbabwe’s digital streets — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, were
      similarly flooded with pro-Zanu-PF content: memes, articles, and videos all
      designed and spread to support the long-time ruling party.\n\nThough we had
      worked for more than a decade in North Africa, at the time our work in sub-saharan
      Africa was in its early days. Meedan was in the middle of developing a network
      in East Africa, which included launching a partnership with [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)
      to support the fact-checking ecosystem in the region. Fact-checkers at PesaCheck
      integrated Meedan’s open source toolkit, [Check](http://meedan.com/en/check),
      into their workflows and verified statements from public figures in Kenya, Uganda
      and Tanzania. \n\nComing to Zimbabwe in 2018, we found a nation and people full
      of hope and looking for the political change needed to address decades of corruption
      and the challenges of [their brutal economic situation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview).
      In an earlier [post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
      this year, I wrote about how Robert Mugabe’s retirement from his presidency
      in 2017 opened up the region to a new era. Our invitation to join the Carter
      Center team in Zimbabwe to help partners monitor and assess the role of online
      mis and disinformation represented [the first time in more than a decade that
      international election observers](https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/commonwealth/africa/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-and-election-observation-missions/)
      were able to monitor an election in Zimbabwe, and as such certainly represented
      the first online election media analysis effort there. . In this spirit the
      2018 Zimbabwe presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections (harmonized
      elections) took place on July 30, 2018.\n\n[Our collaborations in Zimbabwe](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
      included the fact-checking initiative [ZimFact](https://zimfact.org/) as well
      as the Centre for Innovation & Technology ([CITE](http://www.cite.org.zw/about-us/)),
      a group in South Zimbabwe that supports initiatives led by youths, journalists,
      and designers. \n\n\n### A new phase of Check Global: Post-Election Narratives\n\nThe
      Kenya elections in 2017 were “marred by serious human rights violations, including
      unlawful killings and beatings by police during protests and house-to-house
      operations” according to[ Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse).
      Under those circumstances, Check Global fact-checking partners CITE (in Zimbabwe)
      \ and PesaCheck  (in Kenya) continued to verify social media evidence after
      the elections and focused on how to hold politicians accountable to their constituencies.\n\nCurrently,
      PesaCheck in Kenya is building a prototype of Wajibisha, which means “to hold
      accountable,” a promise tracker with a focus on fact-checking budgetary promises
      and election promises, for initial deployment in Kenya and Uganda. Promises
      are logged on Meedan 's Check platform covering the following thematic areas
      - Health, Housing, Jobs, Governance, Environment, Traffic Management and Social
      Inclusion (Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities). Updates on the progress
      of delivery on these promises will then reflect on the main promise tracker
      website, which is not yet available to the general public but will be soon.\n\nEric
      Mugendi, the managing editor of PesaCheck, explains their use of Check:: \n\n>
      \"Check as a platform has enabled us to collaborate both within and outside
      our organization to fact-check and verify content. Our team is distributed in
      three countries, and we work on different platforms. Check allows us to keep
      track of what everyone is doing, and ensures that our work is done to the same
      standard. We are exploring new ways to use the platform, and the most promising
      one so far is in keeping track of promises by elected figures. \"\n\nIn Zimbabwe,
      CITE is working on [The Digital Media for Accountability Project](https://www.cite.org.zw/category/factcheckzw/).
      This is an innovative project that combines digital technology, journalistic
      fact-checking skills and capacity building to promote social accountability
      at the local government level. Focusing mainly on Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second
      capital city, the project aims to track and check statements made by the Bulawayo
      City Council. CITE continues to use Check in their daily fact-checking workflow
      to provide citizens with timely, relevant and accurate information on issues
      of local governance, service delivery and public resources management. \n\nCalling
      Check’s workflow “harmonious” and “intuitive,” Sean Ndlovu, co-founder of CITE,
      said: \n\n> \"The Check platform has allowed us at CITE to be able to follow
      up on announcements, promises and proclamations made by local authorities in
      Zimbabwe in a systematic and archival way. The Check platform also allows us
      to collaborate as a team by assigning tasks to each other in a seamless way
      thus helping the team to report on claims in a simple and standardised format.
      \"\n\n### Check Global intersections with different projects at Meedan\n\nWe’ve
      also expanded our work with our current Check Global partners in East Africa
      in that it  is also feeding the capacity of our Claims and Memes Database (CMDb)
      project. The CMDb project was possible by the generous support of Open Tech
      Fund (OTF), and it's an API-accessible repository of fact checked claims and
      debunked visual misinformation from internet repressive countries, where disinformation
      and social network manipulation have become key censorship strategies. As we
      witnessed visual misinformation travel between Kenya and Zimbabwe during the
      elections, we realized the importance of creating an annotated and verified
      database for claims and memes. \n\nIn July 2019, I was honored to travel to
      Kenya to participate in a collaborative pop-up newsroom to counter misinformation
      during the Kenyan census. This effort was organized by Meedan and supported
      by Article 19. During this pop-up workshop we collected, annotated, and verified
      Kenyan memes based on the census.\n\n### What's new for Check Global in East
      Africa in 2020?\n\nAs the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced the COVID-19
      outbreak as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus.\n\nEast African countries face different challenges
      on many levels, not only in terms of weakened [public health services](https://time.com/5816299/coronavirus-africa-ventilators-doctors/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=world_&linkId=85995855)
      and infrastructure, but also rising [mis/disinformation on social media platforms](https://www.article19.org/resources/coronavirus-new-article-19-briefing-on-tackling-misinformation/),
      lacking [access to public records and information](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/why-access-to-information-on-covid-19-is-crucial-to-persons-with-disabilities-in-africa/),
      [severe cutbacks to free speech](https://ifex.org/covid-19-in-africa-right-to-information-another-casualty-with-spike-in-attacks-on-journalists/),
      [internet and telecom accessibility issues](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-internet-is-making-stay-at-home-difficult-for-africans/a-53048013),
      and worsening [civil rights violations](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/cipesa-submission-to-un-special-rapporteur-spotlights-rights-concerns-in-africas-covid-19-response/).\n\n__Meedan
      launched [new COVID-19 microgrants](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/)__
      to support independent media projects in Africa. Our goal was to support journalists,
      activists and citizen journalists to explore open source investigations and
      verification storytelling. \n\nWe are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely
      in East Africa with our partners, with whom we are discussing and adapting new
      ways of virtual training programs that, while it will no longer require the
      physical attendance of participants, will continue to keep them involved. \n\n[CITE](https://www.cite.org.zw/)
      just launched an online learning platform '[Funda](http://funda.cite.org.zw/)'
      (meaning 'learn' in [Ndebele](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ndebele-Zimbabwean-people)),
      relying on online learning resources from [Nawa Media](https://nawamedia.org/courses/),
      a separate Check Global project that brings together journalism students across
      five countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) across North Africa,
      West Asia to instill the next generation of Arab-speaking journalists with open-source
      investigation tools, fact-checking skills, and an acumen for digital and media
      literacy. \n\nSeparately, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) is creating two
      massive open online courses (MOOC), one on general fact-checking processes using
      Check and another on how to build Promise Tracking using Check. PesaCheck will
      conduct virtual training using these modules with four different newsrooms in
      Kenya.\n\n\nThis increased inter-partner collaboration, not only manifested
      in East Africa, has accelerated and strengthened Meedan’s aspirations to bring
      our partners together within the [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
      The Network  virtually launched on May 5, 2020.. \n\n\n### Events\n\nIn light
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not attending events this year, as a number
      of the conferences we typically attend have been canceled. That said, we are
      moving this energy online and hosting  a series of online conversations. Please
      stay tuned for more info on these virtual events by following us on social media
      or on our newsletter. \n\nWe invite all our partners to send us tips and ideas
      for our weekly newsletter, [The Checklist](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=8fa4ab9399),

    body: "This week, Meedan welcomes medical doctor and award-winning journalist,
      Dr. Seema Yasmin to our COVID-19 team. \n\nHer role will include sharing highlights
      from Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database, a new tool supported by major tech funders
      and foundations, which engages public health experts to provide newsworthy insights
      into complex pandemic science. \n\nYou’ll be able to find Dr. Yasmin’s highlights
      in our weekly newsletter, The Checklist, and on even more platforms soon. [Sign
      up](https://meedan.com/checklist) for the Checklist. To learn more about the
      COVID-19 Expert Database or to see how your newsroom or fact-checking organization
      can get involved, email <a href=\"health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.
      \n\n“Journalists are under immense pressure to report quickly, frequently, and
      accurately, during the pandemic,” said Dr. Yasmin. “That requires sifting through
      dozens of new studies published each day, analyzing complex methodology, and
      translating technical language into content for broad audiences — in addition
      to protecting the public from false narratives and dangerous myths spread by
      some politicians and bad actors. The Expert Database supports reporters and
      fact-checkers, helping them verify information so they can publish the kind
      of nuanced, accurate, and up-to-date content that the public demands during
      the global health crisis of our generation.\"\n\nEach week, Dr. Yasmin will
      curate key selections from the COVID-19 Expert Database and provide an added
      layer of context onto those pieces of information. This will help fact-checkers
      and journalists who use the COVID-19 Expert Database understand the most important
      content from around the world.\n\nDr. Yasmin is a physician-journalist who served
      as an officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention, before training as a journalist and reporting on the
      front lines of epidemics such as of Ebola, Zika, gun violence, and more. She
      trained in journalism at the University of Toronto and in medicine at the University
      of Cambridge. \n\nYasmin was [a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking
      news](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017) in 2017 with a team
      from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on
      neglected diseases. She has received two grants from the Pulitzer Center on
      Crisis Reporting and in 2017 she was selected as a John S. Knight Fellow in
      Journalism at Stanford University where she investigated the spread of health
      misinformation and disinformation during epidemics.\n\nWe are excited to work
      with Dr. Yasmin on amplifying these highlights to our audience. Stay tuned for
      more updates on the COVID-19 Expert Database soon, including more platforms
      for broadcasting highlights and an introduction to our entire team of experts.\n"

    body: "Over the past few weeks, a number of Meedan team members have been attending
      Reboot’s online series on [Driving Transformative Collaboration](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/).
      As the workshop describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse
      coalitions to advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts
      must draw on the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our
      activists, the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence
      of our media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of
      the private sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan,
      we work at the intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists,
      academics, policy researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at
      a global scale, and so this is a topic close to our heart. We wrote previously
      about insights we gained from the first event. Here are three more from the
      most recent two events:\n\n### Do the work before the work.\n\nWorking with
      different sectors and personas from all over the world, we found it really helpful
      to “do the work before the work” and understand our collaborators’ interests,
      anxieties and agendas before getting together. Knowing about their journeys
      and impact will allow us to introduce unheard perspectives and this can be extended
      to our collaborators themselves getting to know each other! We can do this by
      creating materials and sharing a synthesized version across the collaborators
      of a specific project, we can then ground on the communalities we have and we
      may think about a shared problem ahead of time.\n\n\n### Document document document.
      Even when it’s hard.\n\nThe Reboot team shared an all-too-familiar sentiment
      with participants about the often conflicted relationship that can be experienced
      with documentation – it can take quite some time to develop the documentation
      that teams need to stay organized and aligned, but these documents are well
      worth the investment. Keeping information up-to-date and organized can help
      to ensure expectations are shared and agreed-upon by the team, and a short-term
      investment in documentation can help prevent challenges in alignment in the
      future. \n\n\n### When everything’s important, create structures for alignment.\n\nIt
      can seem like everything’s important. And that’s true. But that also creates
      barrier for getting a project started. The Arc of Alignment that Reboot’s team
      articulated enables an excellent framework, which felt very much like a masterclass
      in meeting facilitation. “Brainstorm, with Bumpers” is something I think all
      program and product managers have to navigate, and the toolkit they’ve provided
      is one we use a lot at Meedan - facilitated conversation through structured
      whiteboarding and post-it sessions, followed by group prioritization. The brainstorming
      is part of the work, and with that necessarily comes tension. How teams navigate
      that tension is part of what distinguishes success from struggles.\n\nThis is
      part 2 of a [two-part series](https://meedan.com/blog/3-things-we-learned-on-designing-collaborations-from-the-reboots-masterclass/)."

    body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
      we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
      is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
      is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
      two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you
      have water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
      economies where most of the population live in [urban dense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html)
      areas the outcome of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to
      remember the power we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create
      new and inclusive pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts
      as a speaker and as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon
      in México, which occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n>
      \"Para cambiar los medios necessitamos cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media
      we will need to change it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO
      of Chicas Poderosas, at the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This
      speech set the tone for the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas
      an all-female digital media professinals network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn
      a historic building at the center of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican
      states got together for two days with the goal of creating multimedia projects
      on subjects relevant to their context and based on the current sexual assaults
      occurring in the country. \n\nTo get to this meeting spot you would have to
      first find yourself on a street right behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic
      church that is part of a series of buildings that stand today on top of what
      used to be The Templo Mayor, the heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event
      started, the women took pictures first of the stage and the speakers, but slowly
      as they started to chat with each other during the activities of the day, selfies
      emerged— a prelude to the professional relationships and friendships that were
      forged at these events. Despite the grey building, colors were abundant in Chicas
      banners, participant's hairs, [pañuelos](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2019/06/08/color-por-color-que-significan-los-24-panuelos-que-se-venden-en-las-calles-portenas/)
      and children's toys. \n\n\nA little girl was running between the participants'
      tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with her mother's camera.
      A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced and taken care of
      by the community. In Latin America there is an increasing number of women self
      identifying as [household heads](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/unequal-family-lives/families-in-latin-america/27F2E01B797AD1489A238BFDF2075F1C/core-reader),
      and as they become mothers the participation in professional events declines,
      as do career development opportunities. This effect is known as the [baby penalty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813
      \"Baby Penalty\"). The presence of kids in this event set a precedent for Chicas,
      and in 2020 all Mediathons will make clear in their calls to the community that
      mothers and children are welcome *(due to COVID-19 pandemic Mediathons will
      be held online)*. \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those
      of a call for action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist
      spaces, and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was
      composed of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers,
      and journalists. All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of
      diverse personalities: a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\n###
      The Mediathon Model: Building a community by building safe spaces\n\nTo ensure
      that the room was transformed into a safe space, [rules of behavior ](http://chicaspoderosas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Co%CC%81digo-Chicas-ES.pdf
      \"Chicas Code of conduct\")and engagement were shared as soon as the event began.
      Chicas defines a safe a place as one that is free of social, cultural, racial
      and sexual oppression. The material with the code of conduct was sent to the
      participants beforehand, and they were reminded by the organizers that they
      were always available to answer any questions and to help if something that
      violated the code or made them feel uncomfortable happened. A few members were
      defined as the go-to people for any woman that felt the code was violated. There
      were only a few men present, of those, most were working at the catering service
      and only a couple representing NGOs that were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons
      are made real thanks to Chicas volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in
      which they run an event. The team organizing it was composed of members that
      first started by attending or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around
      Latin America, which is a common way to get to know and be a part of the community.
      In this case, most of them were not from México City and had instead traveled
      from distant provinces. \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered
      around a contextualized issue, in this case, violence against women in México.
      The first segment involved local NGOs and communities presenting their work
      on gender violence, violence against women journalists, abortion and reproductive
      rights. After that, the participants decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate
      further, and teams formed around the multimedia projects. On the second day,
      \ women leaders in their field presented issues on which they are experts, such
      as online engagement, online security, and fact-checking tools (this last one
      was presented by a zombie-like me while I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX
      dry climate). After this, they worked on the projects with their mentors and
      at the end presented their multimedia projects and timelines.\n\nThe highlight
      of this experience was when one of the participants started presenting her project
      in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped, shouted and, safe to say, I had
      goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that systematically erased (and still
      does) the existence of the indigenous population, it was humbling to hear that
      ancient and important language. That woman speaking summed to me what Chicas
      is about: sharing and saving space for underrepresented voices that shape our
      communities. \n\n### One-month mentoring projects\n\nThe projects presented
      were about a myriad of subjects: abortion, sexuality, a radio community directed
      to indigenous women focusing on fighting gender violence in 6 different local
      languages, child and teenage pregnancies, masculinity and gender roles. \n\n[Here](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/historias-que-ponen-nuestras-vocesenalza-ad1b31907010)

      at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
      in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is
      working on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate,
      sustain and expand their community using digital tools. This year one of the
      initiatives we will be supporting Chicas is the [Conversaciones Poderosas en
      La Pandemia COVID-19](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/conversacionespoderosas-en-la-pandemia-de-covid-19-71daa8ea523f
      \"Conversaciones Poderosas\"), a space to talk about the various challenges
      that the pandemic presents on a professional and personal level for journalists,
      share ideas on how to face them and exchange points of view from different countries.
      The objective is to create a space of containment, learning and accompaniment
      for the community."
