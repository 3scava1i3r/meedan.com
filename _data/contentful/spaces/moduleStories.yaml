    body: "To wake up in Brazil in 2020 is to confront daily headlines that send us
      back to 1968, our years of military dictatorship. We see headlines such as:
      Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro [suspends](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/07/bolsonaro-removes-surging-coronavirus-death-toll-official-websites/
      \"Bolsonaro removes number of deaths\") publication of number of deaths; the
      government demands a [recount](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/governo-vai-recontar-numero-de-mortos-por-covid-19-diz-secretario-da-saude.shtml
      \"Bolsonaro's govenament wants to recount the number of deaths \") of the death
      numbers saying they are \"inflated\". Meanwhile Brazilian scientists estimate
      that the number of underreported victims of COVID-19 is [seven times higher](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/numero-de-casos-de-covid-19-no-brasil-pode-ser-ate-sete-vezes-maior-do-que-oficial-diz-pesquisa-1-24445874
      \"Number of deaths can be seven times higher than the official numbers, says
      research\") than what has been reported. This means that according to the [official
      data](https://www.publico.pt/2020/06/05/mundo/noticia/brasil-morre-pessoa-minuto-devido-covid19-1919572
      \"According to offcial data one person dies per minute due to covid-19 in Brazil\"),every
      minute, a person dies from COVID-19 in Brazil. \n\nIn Latin America the erasure
      of data and memory, lack of transparency and the rise of scientific and [historical](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml
      \"Bolsonaro denies the existance of Brazil's military dictatorship past\") denialism
      is nothing new, much less in Brazil. For a [brief period ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/referencia-global-sobre-covid-19-universidade-johns-hopkins-interrompe-contagem-de-dados-do-brasil-1-24466845?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=O%20Globo
      \"Johns Hopkins University interrupts feed of Brazil COVID-19 data\")of time
      this week, Brazil was removed from the Johns Hopkins University ranking that
      globally counts the number of victims of the pandemic. This was a result of
      the decision taken on June 2nd by Bolsonaro to [take down](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/governo-esconde-totais-de-mortes-casos-da-covid-19-tira-site-do-ar-1-24466314
      \"Brazillian governament takes down COVID-19 death numbers from official website\")
      the website that provides data on deaths by COVID-19 in the country. Upon making
      them available again this Friday, the government decided that it would focus
      on the number of [victims recovered ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/portal-da-covid-19-volta-ao-ar-mas-sem-total-de-casos-mortes-sem-planilha-com-dados-detalhados-1-24466899
      \"Offcial Helath portal comes back with data without the numbers breakdown\")and
      those who have died in the past 24 hours. A breakdown of the data by region,
      and by total number of deaths will no longer be available. \n\nThe government
      also decided to recount the dead and check the math as it believes the numbers
      were [\"made up\"](https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/bela-megale/post/ministerio-da-saude-vai-recontar-mortos-pela-covid-19-porque-diz-ver-dados-fantasiosos.html
      \"Governament wants to recount the numbers saying they are made up\"). It is
      not the first time that this government has questioned the data provided by
      scientific organizations. In July 2019, when asked about the exponential growth
      of deforestation in the Amazon,the Chief Minister of the Institutional Security
      Office, General Augusto Heleno, said that the data was [\"manipulated\"](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/indices-de-desmatamento-na-amazonia-sao-manipulados-diz-ministro-augusto-heleno.shtml
      \"Minister Augusto Heleno says Amazon deforestation data was manipulated\")
      by the National Institute for Space Research (INSPE). More recently, this scientific
      denialism has manifested in the firing of the Women's Health Coordination Team
      at the Ministry of Health, due to the publication of a technical note that addresses
      access to sexual and reproductive health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Several organizations [denounced](http://www.visibilidadefeminina.org/noticias
      \"Visibilidade Feminina website\") this decision, among them Visibilidade Feminina
      (Feminine Visibility), a non-profit civil organization that aims to promote
      the role of women in public and private spaces of power.\n\nThe majority of
      the victims in the COVID-19 pandemic are black, according to a survey by [Agência
      Pública](https://apublica.org/2020/05/em-duas-semanas-numero-de-negros-mortos-por-coronavirus-e-cinco-vezes-maior-no-brasil/
      \"In two weeks the number of black vistims is five times higher\"), and they
      are victims of a racist and genocidal policy imposed by the Bolsonaro government
      which [plays down the effects of the pandemic](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/23/americas/brazil-coronavirus-hospitals-intl/index.html
      \"CNN article on Brazil hospitals\"). The number of black victims with low literacy
      is four times higher than that of white people with a higher education level,
      as revealed by the [research carried](http://www.ctc.puc-rio.br/diferencas-sociais-confirmam-que-pretos-e-pardos-morrem-mais-de-covid-19-do-que-brancos-segundo-nt11-do-nois/
      \"Research says that more black people die due to COVID-19\") out by PUC-RIO.
      And this week we also learned that the virus is [twice as lethal](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-humanos/noticia/2020-06/covid-19-agrava-violacoes-contra-indigenas-yanomami-diz-estudo
      \" Study says COVID-19 agravates violations against Yanomamis\")  to the Yanomami
      tribe, and due to the mining and deforestation activities [supported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-amazon-indigenous.html
      \"Bolsonaro governament and the Amazon\") by Bolsonaro's government in the Amazon
      forest, they are even more vulnerable. Scientists currently estimate a 6.45%
      death rate among the Yanomami population, according to [a study](https://acervo.socioambiental.org/acervo/publicacoes-isa/o-impacto-da-pandemia-na-terra-indigena-yanomami-foragarimpoforacovid
      \"Study about the impact of the pandemic on the Yanomami population\") conducted
      by the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) and the Federal University of Minas Gerais.\n\n###
      Learning from our recent past \n\nState violence, such as what we are living
      through today, generates [trauma](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30408012
      \"Moment of Truth for Brazil's military past\") in the fabric of society that
      needs to be repaired to avoid a repeat of our recent past, where there has been
      an erasure of popular history of collective resistance. After the transitional
      justice process post-dictartorship was done we did not, for example, [hold the
      military to account](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2019-01-01/ghosts-brazils-military-dictatorship
      \"Ghosts of Brazil's military dictatorship\").\n\nOne lesson we did learn was
      the importance of memory as a practice of resistance. By preserving historical
      artifacts such as testimonies, documents, images and videos during and after
      the dictatorship period we were able, more or less effectively, to carry out
      recovery processes through the [National Commission of Truth](https://www.conectas.org/en/news/final-report-of-the-national-truth-commission-what-now-brazil
      \"Final Report of the national truth comission\") that addressed missing persons,
      the exiled and victims of political crimes. After the dictatorship, the Brazilian
      Constitution of 1988 sought to heal some secular wounds as a result of the efforts
      of civil society that demanded the creation of SUS, our universal health system
      which provides access to health for the Brazilian population. It is this same
      system that during the COVID-19 pandemic is collapsing in several states of
      the country, proving that it is [underfunded](https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/o-sus-e-o-direito-a-saude-em-tempos-de-coronavirus/
      \"About SUS and the constitucional right to acess health\"), even while being
      essential.\n\nThe cruelty of this historical moment becomes acute, when, in
      addition to burying our dead in [collective graves](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-brazil-mass-graves-experts-anticipate-covid-19-deaths-2020-5
      \"Photos of Brazil mass graves\"), remembering their lives, and surviving a
      pandemic, we still urgently need to preserve data and documents, in order for
      compensation to be possible in the future to the families of the victims of
      this policy. \n\n\n### Acting while we suffer: online collective mourning and
      self-organizing \n\nMemory as resistance is being articulated by the [Memorial
      of Victims of COVID-19 in Brazil](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
      \"Facebook page of the covid-19 memorial\"), a Facebook page that aims to honor
      victims and tell their stories. And it is one of the initiatives of the [Support
      Network for the Families of Fatal Victims of Covid-19 in Brazil](https://seguraaonda.com.br/nasce-a-rede-de-apoio-as-familias-de-vitimas-fatais-do-covid-19-no-brasil/),
      an emergency network made up of volunteers, professionals and people in solidarity
      with the families of victims in the country, in their honor. The network's objectives
      are to: provide guidance for funerals, burials and farewell rituals and to create
      channels to guarantee the right to memory and wakes (even if virtual) and due
      tribute to the dead. \n\nNews portal [G1](http://especiais.g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/memorial-vitimas-covid-19/#/
      \"G1 COVID-19 omline Memorial\"), has responded to this collective need of mourning
      by creating an online memorial with the victim's obituaries. Another example
      is [Inumeráveis ](https://inumeraveis.com.br/ \"Inumeráveis website\")(Innumerable)
      a collaborative and volunteer virtual memorial effort with the premise that
      no one likes to be a number, according to them, people deserve to exist in prose.
      Their editorial process involves families of the victims, journalists and researchers.
      It was built as a space to celebrate life.\n\nTo articulate how self organizing
      is important for the indigenous population in Brazil in challenging the state
      narrative you only have to compare the numbers of confirmed deaths recorded
      by families and communities with the official numbers that the government shares
      from the Special Indigenous Health Secretariat (Sesai). In some cases they are
      [three times](https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2020/06/01/18-mil-indigenas-sao-infectados-por-covid-19-em-78-povos-no-brasil-diz-organizacao.ghtml
      \"Numbers of infected indigenous population\") higher according to Articulation
      of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil (Apib) their aim is to preserve victims’ memory.\n\n\n###
      Preserving memory as a path forward\n\n> \"Memory is, in itself, an end, a strategy
      to repair the damage caused to human rights and is a way to reconcile a society\"
      comments Professor Isabel Piper Shafir, from the Faculty of Social Sciences
      at the University of Chile, about the post-dictatorship reparation processes
      in Chile. \n\nTo ensure that we can use memory as a strategy for reparation,
      the work of civil organizations, activists, technologists, historians, researchers
      and journalists is essential to the archiving and preservation process. \n\nUnderstanding
      our current information ecosystem can be part of the strategy for the sustainability
      of these archives and collections of data. The memorial of the Covid-19 victims
      in Brazil is hosted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
      \"Facebook page of the Memorial for Victms of COVID-19 in Brazil\")'s platform;
      in practical terms this means that the content, those collectively woven threads
      of memory, are being stored and held by a corporate social media platform. These
      corporations are becoming the record keepers of a country's history while there
      is still a [total lack of transparency](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/facebook-instagram-lack-transparency-government-ordered-content-removal-amid
      \"EFF: Facebook and Instagram lack transparency\") regarding their content moderation
      policies. Often we don't know why they take something down, leaving their motivation
      unclear and leaving us to wonder: was this content [censored](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive
      \"Instagram shadow bans marginalised communities\")? Was it a technical error?
      Or did it infringe the platform's policies?\n\nA possible response is using
      open source technology to contribute to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard
      content and history, helping to preserve context and ownership, as well as ensuring
      data collection and transparency for future accountability. \n\nThere are several
      formats of how civil organizations and open source communities can cooperate
      in these efforts some examples are: creating open source investigations to collect
      data on the victims of COVID-19 using [Check](https://meedan.com/check \"Check
      - Meedan website\"), or using archiving software such as Huridoc's [Uwazi ](https://www.uwazi.io/
      \"Uwazi website\")to curate and publish human rights documentation that could
      make important, public information more accessible, as well as using the OpenArchive’s
      [app Save](https://open-archive.org/save/ \"Save website\") to streamline media
      workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting while encrypting the media.
      Another open source approach comes from [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/ \"DocNow
      website\") whose focus is on archiving social media activist content, they do
      this by engaging directly with communities and [co-creating](https://news.docnow.io/documenting-activism-now-17db7b956fcf
      \"DocNow blog post on Documenting Activism\") through workshops solutions that
      are customized to their needs and workflows. \n\nLet's learn from our past historical
      erasures and organize ourselves to use current technology to safeguard our memory
      but also to understand the limitations of certain tools and products. Perhaps
      this time around, we can say that in spite of our collective shock and loss
      we honored our loved ones by mourning, remembering and saving space for future
      reparation. And hopefully as we walk on the coronavirus-free streets again we
      will do it in spaces that, different from today, are liberated of rotting statues
      and avenues named after the generals that were responsible for digging mass
      graves in times past. \n"

    body: "All injustices have at their core an abuse of power. Systemic injustices
      ingrain these abuses into the structure of our societies, into the mechanics
      of how power, money, opportunity, and—as the past months have made so brutally
      apparent—health is accessed and distributed. \n\nAs an organization that is
      ultimately built on the premise that truth and knowledge are contextual, we
      have an obligation to the truth that exceeds our commitment to non-partisanship.
      We in the strongest possible terms condemn the killings of George Floyd and
      Breonna Taylor, and we criticize US national leadership, whose lack of contrition
      and unwillingness or inability to empathize with the very clear sentiments of
      millions of Americans in this moment is a profound and damaging failure.\n\nMeedan,
      while founded in the US, is a global technology non-profit working with media
      partners around the world, primarily in the global south. Our partners work
      to document human rights abuses in Yemen, uncover political corruption in the
      Philippines, and empower young investigative journalists and fact-checkers in
      Africa. We have designed our organization in response to the single question:
      \"What can we do as engineers, program managers, researchers and designers to
      address injustice and inequity in digital spaces?\"\n\nThis moment of social
      rage is of profound concern. We must demand more of our institutions and of
      our leaders, especially with regards to systemic racism against Black communities.
      Every sector of our society from the institutions of our government, to our
      corporations, to the media, to our universities, to the technology platforms,
      to organizations like ours must make an aggressively anti-racist approach core
      to our business models, our missions and our daily work.\n\nAt Meedan we commit
      to honoring the memory of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and all those whose
      lives and livelihoods have been harmed by anti-blackness, racism, hatred and
      disinformation. So much more needs to be done, and we commit to using our work---our
      tools, our programs, and our research---to helping in this effort.\n\n\n— Ed

    body: "In July 2018, I traveled to Zimbabwe to join The Carter Center to work
      with civil society organizations and newsrooms on tracking and addressing misinformation
      around the first harmonized elections in the country after Robert Mugabe stepped
      down.\n\nWhen I arrived in Zimbabwe, election-related propaganda was all over
      news media and social media. As an Egyptian, I was all too familiar with this
      kind of information ecosystem: mainstream media is owned by the state, and its
      goal is simply to amplify and spread one side of the story — that of those in
      power. Wandering the streets of Harare, it was impossible not to notice the
      dominance of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front
      ([Zanu-PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU%E2%80%93PF)) in its use of posters
      and billboards. Zimbabwe’s digital streets — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, were
      similarly flooded with pro-Zanu-PF content: memes, articles, and videos all
      designed and spread to support the long-time ruling party.\n\nThough we had
      worked for more than a decade in North Africa, at the time our work in sub-saharan
      Africa was in its early days. Meedan was in the middle of developing a network
      in East Africa, which included launching a partnership with [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)
      to support the fact-checking ecosystem in the region. Fact-checkers at PesaCheck
      integrated Meedan’s open source toolkit, [Check](http://meedan.com/en/check),
      into their workflows and verified statements from public figures in Kenya, Uganda
      and Tanzania. \n\nComing to Zimbabwe in 2018, we found a nation and people full
      of hope and looking for the political change needed to address decades of corruption
      and the challenges of [their brutal economic situation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview).
      In an earlier [post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
      this year, I wrote about how Robert Mugabe’s retirement from his presidency
      in 2017 opened up the region to a new era. Our invitation to join the Carter
      Center team in Zimbabwe to help partners monitor and assess the role of online
      mis and disinformation represented [the first time in more than a decade that
      international election observers](https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/commonwealth/africa/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-and-election-observation-missions/)
      were able to monitor an election in Zimbabwe, and as such certainly represented
      the first online election media analysis effort there. . In this spirit the
      2018 Zimbabwe presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections (harmonized
      elections) took place on July 30, 2018.\n\n[Our collaborations in Zimbabwe](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)

      as the Centre for Innovation & Technology ([CITE](http://www.cite.org.zw/about-us/)),
      a group in South Zimbabwe that supports initiatives led by youths, journalists,
      and designers. \n\n\n### A new phase of Check Global: Post-Election Narratives\n\nThe
      Kenya elections in 2017 were “marred by serious human rights violations, including
      unlawful killings and beatings by police during protests and house-to-house
      operations” according to[ Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse).
      Under those circumstances, Check Global fact-checking partners CITE (in Zimbabwe)
      \ and PesaCheck  (in Kenya) continued to verify social media evidence after
      the elections and focused on how to hold politicians accountable to their constituencies.\n\nCurrently,
      PesaCheck in Kenya is building a prototype of Wajibisha, which means “to hold
      accountable,” a promise tracker with a focus on fact-checking budgetary promises
      and election promises, for initial deployment in Kenya and Uganda. Promises
      are logged on Meedan 's Check platform covering the following thematic areas
      - Health, Housing, Jobs, Governance, Environment, Traffic Management and Social
      Inclusion (Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities). Updates on the progress
      of delivery on these promises will then reflect on the main promise tracker
      website, which is not yet available to the general public but will be soon.\n\nEric
      Mugendi, the managing editor of PesaCheck, explains their use of Check:: \n\n>
      \"Check as a platform has enabled us to collaborate both within and outside
      our organization to fact-check and verify content. Our team is distributed in
      three countries, and we work on different platforms. Check allows us to keep
      track of what everyone is doing, and ensures that our work is done to the same
      standard. We are exploring new ways to use the platform, and the most promising
      one so far is in keeping track of promises by elected figures. \"\n\nIn Zimbabwe,
      CITE is working on [The Digital Media for Accountability Project](https://www.cite.org.zw/category/factcheckzw/).
      This is an innovative project that combines digital technology, journalistic
      fact-checking skills and capacity building to promote social accountability
      at the local government level. Focusing mainly on Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second
      capital city, the project aims to track and check statements made by the Bulawayo
      City Council. CITE continues to use Check in their daily fact-checking workflow
      to provide citizens with timely, relevant and accurate information on issues
      of local governance, service delivery and public resources management. \n\nCalling
      Check’s workflow “harmonious” and “intuitive,” Sean Ndlovu, co-founder of CITE,
      said: \n\n> \"The Check platform has allowed us at CITE to be able to follow
      up on announcements, promises and proclamations made by local authorities in
      Zimbabwe in a systematic and archival way. The Check platform also allows us
      to collaborate as a team by assigning tasks to each other in a seamless way
      thus helping the team to report on claims in a simple and standardised format.
      \"\n\n### Check Global intersections with different projects at Meedan\n\nWe’ve
      also expanded our work with our current Check Global partners in East Africa
      in that it  is also feeding the capacity of our Claims and Memes Database (CMDb)
      project. The CMDb project was possible by the generous support of Open Tech
      Fund (OTF), and it's an API-accessible repository of fact checked claims and
      debunked visual misinformation from internet repressive countries, where disinformation
      and social network manipulation have become key censorship strategies. As we
      witnessed visual misinformation travel between Kenya and Zimbabwe during the
      elections, we realized the importance of creating an annotated and verified
      database for claims and memes. \n\nIn July 2019, I was honored to travel to
      Kenya to participate in a collaborative pop-up newsroom to counter misinformation
      during the Kenyan census. This effort was organized by Meedan and supported
      by Article 19. During this pop-up workshop we collected, annotated, and verified
      Kenyan memes based on the census.\n\n### What's new for Check Global in East
      Africa in 2020?\n\nAs the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced the COVID-19
      outbreak as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus.\n\nEast African countries face different challenges
      on many levels, not only in terms of weakened [public health services](https://time.com/5816299/coronavirus-africa-ventilators-doctors/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=world_&linkId=85995855)
      and infrastructure, but also rising [mis/disinformation on social media platforms](https://www.article19.org/resources/coronavirus-new-article-19-briefing-on-tackling-misinformation/),
      lacking [access to public records and information](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/why-access-to-information-on-covid-19-is-crucial-to-persons-with-disabilities-in-africa/),
      [severe cutbacks to free speech](https://ifex.org/covid-19-in-africa-right-to-information-another-casualty-with-spike-in-attacks-on-journalists/),
      [internet and telecom accessibility issues](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-internet-is-making-stay-at-home-difficult-for-africans/a-53048013),
      and worsening [civil rights violations](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/cipesa-submission-to-un-special-rapporteur-spotlights-rights-concerns-in-africas-covid-19-response/).\n\n__Meedan
      launched [new COVID-19 microgrants](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/)__
      to support independent media projects in Africa. Our goal was to support journalists,
      activists and citizen journalists to explore open source investigations and
      verification storytelling. \n\nWe are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely
      in East Africa with our partners, with whom we are discussing and adapting new
      ways of virtual training programs that, while it will no longer require the
      physical attendance of participants, will continue to keep them involved. \n\n[CITE](https://www.cite.org.zw/)
      just launched an online learning platform '[Funda](http://funda.cite.org.zw/)'
      (meaning 'learn' in [Ndebele](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ndebele-Zimbabwean-people)),
      relying on online learning resources from [Nawa Media](https://nawamedia.org/courses/),
      a separate Check Global project that brings together journalism students across
      five countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) across North Africa,
      West Asia to instill the next generation of Arab-speaking journalists with open-source
      investigation tools, fact-checking skills, and an acumen for digital and media
      literacy. \n\nSeparately, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) is creating two
      massive open online courses (MOOC), one on general fact-checking processes using
      Check and another on how to build Promise Tracking using Check. PesaCheck will
      conduct virtual training using these modules with four different newsrooms in
      Kenya.\n\n\nThis increased inter-partner collaboration, not only manifested
      in East Africa, has accelerated and strengthened Meedan’s aspirations to bring
      our partners together within the [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
      The Network  virtually launched on May 5, 2020.. \n\n\n### Events\n\nIn light
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not attending events this year, as a number
      of the conferences we typically attend have been canceled. That said, we are
      moving this energy online and hosting  a series of online conversations. Please
      stay tuned for more info on these virtual events by following us on social media
      or on our newsletter. \n\nWe invite all our partners to send us tips and ideas
      for our weekly newsletter, [The Checklist](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=8fa4ab9399),
      weekly misinformation news around the world. Meedan's Digital Health Lab is
      working with a team of scientists to answer the most important and complex pandemic
      questions. Each week, we highlight [the most important questions](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=70729b5123)

    body: "Over the past few weeks, a number of Meedan team members have been attending
      Reboot’s online series on [Driving Transformative Collaboration](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/).
      As the workshop describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse
      coalitions to advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts
      must draw on the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our
      activists, the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence
      of our media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of
      the private sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan,
      we work at the intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists,
      academics, policy researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at
      a global scale, and so this is a topic close to our heart. We wrote previously
      about insights we gained from the first event. Here are three more from the
      most recent two events:\n\n### Do the work before the work.\n\nWorking with
      different sectors and personas from all over the world, we found it really helpful
      to “do the work before the work” and understand our collaborators’ interests,
      anxieties and agendas before getting together. Knowing about their journeys
      and impact will allow us to introduce unheard perspectives and this can be extended
      to our collaborators themselves getting to know each other! We can do this by
      creating materials and sharing a synthesized version across the collaborators
      of a specific project, we can then ground on the communalities we have and we
      may think about a shared problem ahead of time.\n\n\n### Document document document.
      Even when it’s hard.\n\nThe Reboot team shared an all-too-familiar sentiment
      with participants about the often conflicted relationship that can be experienced
      with documentation – it can take quite some time to develop the documentation
      that teams need to stay organized and aligned, but these documents are well
      worth the investment. Keeping information up-to-date and organized can help
      to ensure expectations are shared and agreed-upon by the team, and a short-term
      investment in documentation can help prevent challenges in alignment in the
      future. \n\n\n### When everything’s important, create structures for alignment.\n\nIt
      can seem like everything’s important. And that’s true. But that also creates
      barrier for getting a project started. The Arc of Alignment that Reboot’s team
      articulated enables an excellent framework, which felt very much like a masterclass
      in meeting facilitation. “Brainstorm, with Bumpers” is something I think all
      program and product managers have to navigate, and the toolkit they’ve provided
      is one we use a lot at Meedan - facilitated conversation through structured
      whiteboarding and post-it sessions, followed by group prioritization. The brainstorming
      is part of the work, and with that necessarily comes tension. How teams navigate
      that tension is part of what distinguishes success from struggles.\n\nThis is
      part 2 of a [two-part series](https://meedan.com/blog/3-things-we-learned-on-designing-collaborations-from-the-reboots-masterclass/)."
