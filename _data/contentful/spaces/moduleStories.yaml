    body: "Today at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/), the largest
      worldwide gathering of fact-checkers, global technology not-for-profit Meedan
      announced a case study of a global fact-checking project using the [WhatsApp
      Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api). The groundbreaking study
      is based on nearly 5,700 fact-checks across India, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya
      and Nigeria and was made possible with support from WhatsApp and Facebook. \n\n<p
      class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a class=\"button no-margin\" href=\"https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact\">Download
      the full report: End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nFor the project, Meedan
      developed several software features on [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check),
      a web application for journalists to verify and annotate online information
      for open-source investigations, that were customized specifically for global
      fact-checking organizations and deployed by the AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa
      Check, BOOM and India Today. They have  been running since October 2019 across
      4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions
      today. \n\nThe report, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact),
      details the insights, field research and product features made that maximized
      the value of the API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference
      to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on the end-to-end encrypted
      service.   \n\n“Fact-checkers working globally have a variety of needs, so we
      built tools that optimize workflows and the nuances of AI in order to create
      a roadmap for improving fact-checking and information integrity across the web,”
      said Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan. “This effort has been highly collaborative, and we
      appreciate the support and guidance that we were given from the teams at AFP,
      Africa Check, BOOM and India Today in particular.”\n\nThe report offers the
      following core insights:\n\n#### Bots are the new audience engagement paradigm.
      \nA WhatsApp fact-Checking bot can serve three purposes: (1) help audiences
      understand how to interact with the fact-checking team and see commonly-requested
      content, (2) serve as a bridge between a human editor and someone submitting
      content to a tipline and (3) cut down on unactionable content.\n\n#### Machines
      in the loop augment quality human efforts.\nAlready designed for human work,
      Check now automates everything from content matching to intake, helping fact-checkers
      do their jobs more efficiently and therefore effectively.\n\n#### Follow the
      news cycle.\nNewsrooms learned that a topic-oriented approach to tipline promotion
      following the news cycle yields stronger audience engagement and submissions.
      After the outbreak of COVID-19, we saw an uptick in the percentage of quality,
      actionable content, in turn generating better fact-checks.\n\n#### Fact-checkers
      need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces in multiple languages.\nWe adapted our
      toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on the fact-checking rather rather than
      technical tasks. This enabled teams to customize their workflows.\n\n“We used
      to get inundated by the thousands of messages that people would send us on WhatsApp,”
      said Balkrishna, fact-checking editor at [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/).
      “Check has not only made it possible for us to sift through the fact-check requests
      quickly, it also helped deliver most of our readers with fast and personalized
      responses. This helps us build a direct bond of trust with our audience.” \n\n“Check
      really improved the way we communicate with our readers on WhatsApp,” said María
      Clara Pestre, a fact-checker at [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/) (Brazil).
      “Now, we can be sure anyone who reaches out through the app will have an immediate
      and consistent reply, while having time to dedicate ourselves to other parts
      of the verification process.”\n\n“We’re excited to work with partners like Meedan
      to help address the challenge of misinformation within private messaging. Our
      approach is to give users tools to easily get accurate information and support
      fact checking,” said Ben Supple, head of civic engagement at WhatsApp. “We appreciate
      and value the work done to maximize the WhatsApp Business API for fact checkers
      and ensure more people have access to accurate information at the click of a
      button.”\n\nMeedan presented this study at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
      with representatives from WhatsApp, the International Fact Checking Network,
      Boom and Africa Check. See the video from the panel here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnHPLY8uIkY&feature=emb_title\"

      content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnHPLY8uIkY&feature=emb_title</a>\n\nTo
      support this work, Meedan developed a number of key software features that maximized
      the WhatsApp Business API with a mix of AI, interface and multilingual innovations,
      including:\n\n- __Multilingual WhatsApp Bot:__ a customizable bot that presents
      both intuitive menu items and human conversations with fact-checkers in multiple
      languages\n- __Workflow Automation:__ a triage system to recognize, review and
      prioritize claims and responses\n- __Similarity Analysis:__ algorithms that
      detect content patterns and trends based on variations of the same claims\n-
      __Response at Scale:__ a publishing system to send fact-check reports to tipline
      users who send duplicate or similar requests\n\n“Our goal with [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check),”
      explained Meedan’s Director of Product Pierre Conti, “is to build a scalable
      human and AI system for fact-checkers to efficiently size the demand for verification
      directly from their audience, cut through the noise, and maximize impact by
      helping them to prioritize their response to the most pressing misinformation.”"

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Today the health communications organization [Nigeria Health Watch](https://nigeriahealthwatch.com/)
      and Meedan announce a partnership to counter misinformation around COVID-19
      and other public health challenges in Nigeria. This partnership will take place
      through Meedan's [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/).
      \n\nThe spread of misinformation during disease outbreaks is a global issue.
      False or misleading information around disease prevention, treatment and cures
      can can cause confusion and panic, and can be dangerous to public health. There
      is there an urgent need for collaboration to address widespread health misinformation
      as governments tackle the double epidemic of misinformation and COVID-19.\n\nThrough
      the partnership, potentially false or misleading COVID-19 claims will be identified,
      and Nigeria Health Watch will leverage Meedan’s [team of experts](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/about/)
      to produce multimedia messages that debunk misinformation around the virus.
      The multimedia messages will include critical context and background information
      that is key to safely communicating debunks to misinformation. The project will
      apply insights from collated data to create evidence-based media campaigns to
      counter COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nManaging Director at Nigeria Health Watch,
      Vivianne Ihekweazu, said “Misinformation poses a threat to the public response
      to outbreaks, eroding the public’s trust, and their willingness and ability
      to take preventative measures.\" \n\n“As we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. Strained access
      to health experts during emergencies, such as the one we’re experiencing, can
      quickly lead to poor health outcomes, as low-quality information exacerbates
      the real-world spread of disease,” said Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab
      lead. \n\n#### About Nigeria Health Watch\nNigeria Health Watch uses informed
      advocacy and communication to influence health policy and seek better health
      and access to healthcare in Nigeria. We seek to amplify some of the great work
      happening in the health sector, challenge the bad, and create a space for positive
      ideas and action. Through its various platforms, Nigeria Health Watch is a trusted
      source that provides informed commentary and in-depth analysis of health issues
      in Nigeria, always in good conscience. \n\n#### About Meedan\nMeedan is a technology

    body: "The [2020 Global Misinfodemic Report](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/)
      examines the impact of COVID-19 outside of the Global North.\n\n<p class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a

      the report</a>\n</p>\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the [2020 Global Misinfodemic
      Report](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/),
      a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information scholars, legal
      experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining the impacts of
      COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Brazil
      and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts and journalists
      from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and fact-checking organizations,
      the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation into the way this unprecedented
      viral event is both reforming and confirming the state of our global information
      ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, as countries worked to contain the
      first signs of the physical virus spreading, a secondary crisis occured: misinformation
      on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
      [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
      and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
      \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
      UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
      and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health
      advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the
      airwaves. Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going
      viral, stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against
      this disease, too.”\n\nA misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers
      in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
      and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
      leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
      interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
      approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report
      touches on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are
      spreading online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating
      with certain communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation
      on  public health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging
      economies?\n- What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe
      first wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed
      world, but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New
      York Times editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies
      ahead is the spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict,
      through packed refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh,
      through teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social
      distancing is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without
      the fiscal capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would
      be disastrous not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies
      of raw materials are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger
      and the virus doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely
      to ensue, long after countries in North America and Europe control their initial
      outbreaks, is sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about
      the pandemic. In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our
      partners’ fact-checking tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched
      COVID-19 misinformation evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments
      involving tea, vitamins, hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation
      about penalties for spreading misinformation or just spreading information,
      about the pandemic \n- Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this
      misinformation can trigger real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing
      the most obvious and harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where

      [As we've seen](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/using-misinformation-as-a-political-weapon-covid-19-and-bolsonaro-in-brazil/), health misinformation is escalating not only within Western democracies but also at a dangerous scale in emerging economies, where independent media workers and organizations have had to wade through financial, physical, and mental strain. As the Check Global team continued to monitor the ramifications of COVID-19 on emerging economies and independent media organizations, the need to act was undeniable.

      Meedan has engaged in a company-wide effort to address our partners' challenges, whether through building new technologies[ such as the COVID-19 Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/), providing independent newsrooms and partners with [a database led by expert epidemiologists and public health workers](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/) to facilitate fact-checking and verification initiatives, or contributing to [global research](https://meedan.com/blog/global-misinfodemic-report/) about COVID-19-related misinformation. In the interest of reaching out to new organizations in need, the Check Global team announced on April 8 a call to [support media organizations and media workers in Asia-Pacific, in Africa, in Latin America and in the North Africa Western Asia region through a series of micro-grants.](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/) The microgrants projects ranged amongst fact-checking projects, media literacy campaigns and daily blogging reflecting on applicants' quarantine realities. We were blown away by the popularity of our call, receiving a whooping 298 applications in less than 30 days!

      While overwhelming and heartening, the large pool of applications made the selection process challenging. A few criteria guided us in this process. Originality and the innovative nature of the application were  important factors in the selection. Some applications stood out for their creativity and clarity. Applications were also shortlisted on the basis of their achievability --- projects that proposed activities and outputs that could be realistically achieved during the current health crisis were prioritised. Finally, outreach and potential impact were also important factors. Projects that strengthened the involvement of underserved communities and represented issues of people in areas outside the radar of mainstream media made it to the final selection process. We had limited funding, but there are many applications that are deserving, and we hope to be able to support those projects at a later stage.

      In this round, we awarded 25 projects with funding that ranged between $300 and $2,500, for a total of $52,000. From organisations involved in relief work around COVID-19 to individuals committed to tracking the impact of the pandemic on local communities, - the range of applications was wide, rich and diverse. Given the work they do, some of these grantees face risks of political repression, and we're not able to list all of them here. Here are some of the highlights from our work:


      ### APAC: 7 Fact-checking projects targeting vulnerable groups

      We received close to 40 applications from the Asia Pacific region.

      We selected seven applications for media work have been selected from the APAC region for the COVID-19 microgrants. These represent six countries in the region, with a particular focus on Southeast and South Asia --- Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. The creation of online content that is fact-checked and accurate has been an area around which a few groups have designed their projects. [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/) has designed a project to create an online information hub in order to provide fact-checked information to citizens and civil society organisations. In the Philippines, we are thrilled to support the work of an individual, Carol Dawonlay/[Lalang Hu Mga Laga](https://www.facebook.com/pg/storiesofwomencampaign/posts/) who will produce social media cards and videos to highlight violence against women during the pandemic. [BASAbali](https://basabali.org/) in Indonesia is in the process of designing a digital literacy campaign around COVID-19 with the underserved and minority communities in Bali.

      We're also happy to support [Disability Empowerment Society Nepal](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/); they have designed a project to create an accessible website to provide news and information on COVID-19 to people with disabilities. In India, [Sadbhavana Trust](http://sadbhavanatrust.org.in/) will strengthen the leadership and meaningful participation of young women from underserved communities in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak by creating online content from a feminist perspective. [International Youth Alliance for Peace](https://iyapsl.org/) in Sri Lanka will design a  blogging project to capture stories of frontline workers addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

      ### Africa: 6 efforts curbing the ramifications of the COVID-19 misinfodemic

      We were thrilled by the 170 applications we received from Africa, which made up the majority of our overall application pool. Due to our limited funds we were only able to support six  applications from Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, Guinee, Tanzania, Zambia. Here are highlights from four of these.

      [People's Check](http://www.peoplescheck.org/) in Nigeria is launching the 'Verify Nigeria' project to fact-check and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that has affected people's health and life in Nigeria. People's Check will create different visual elements and participate in training students and citizen journalists on health fact-checking training. [Radio Daljir SOMALIA](https://www.daljir.com/) will support media literacy efforts in Somalia and design audio campaigns and radio reporting to bring health facts to the public, encourage COVID-19 prevention measures & make social distancing possible. Radio Daljir will target communities in Somalia's regions of Puntland and Galmudug States of Somalia with a focus on the situation of the nomads. [Zéro Pauvre Afrique (ZPA, "Zero Poor in Africa")](https://www.facebook.com/zeropauvreenafrique/) will track, deconstruct, disseminate misinfodemics with support of a network of volunteers in order to reduce their impact on the management of the COVID-19 crisis in Guinea.

      Family Welfare Foundation's project will contribute to ensuring engagement of human rights defenders and activists with local artists in documenting, information sharing, reporting and amplifying voices on injustice issues, human rights abuse and repressions associated to COVID-19 interventions in Tanzania.

      We are building on the success of the COVID-19 microgrants to create different media funds in Africa that can support more innovative projects.


      ### Latin America: Sustaining the work of 5 women-led independent media organizations

      We received 47 applications from Latin America in both Spanish and Portuguese. The majority of the 7 selected initiatives are led by women and are covering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in their regions. [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/) will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets in Cuba ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)) to increase regional awareness in matters related to the pandemic. Another fact checking initiative [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/) agency works and specializes in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com) a group of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With the theme "From my window" [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas ](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.GDezza.net) and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.

      ### NAWA: Supporting 5 investigations and fact-checking initiatives
      As for applications from the North Africa Western Asia region, we were lucky to receive 24 applications, both in English and Arabic.

      We are pleased and excited to support five projects from the region, divided between media literacy campaigns, fact-checking initiatives and in-depth investigations. [Radio Medenine](http://radiomedenine.com/), a community radio project based in southern Tunisia, aims to create a digital health program interviewing health experts and providing pressing health information. Award-winning collaborative blog [Nawaat](http://nawaat.org/portail/) ("the core" in Arabic), also from Tunisia, will be sustaining its trilingual fact-checking efforts through our grant over the next month, while media platform [SyriaUntold](https://syriauntold.com/en/) will publish a series of investigative reports about health disparities in Syria. We were also happy to fund an investigation on the state of African refugees in Tangier and a health fact-checking campaign in Egypt.

      The above COVID-19 microgrants recipients have given Meedan consent to announce their projects publicly, while others have not been named for security reasons.
