    body: "The bot, which also works on other social messaging platforms, is designed
      to scale response through the COVID crisis and other topical content.\n\nMeedan
      is pleased to roll out Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
      and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
      Twitter DM, and more. Now being tested in Brazil, India and across Africa with
      COVID-19 content, our bot is an extension of [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      our collaborative platform for digital media verification and annotation, to
      boost the work of human journalists through AI-powered claims matching, smart
      menus, and the ability to source new content directly from users for fact-checking.\n\nIt
      has the following key features:\n\n- A fully customizable interaction scenario
      , allowing fact-checking teams to spin up interactive menus of frequently-requested
      content to react to events rapidly  \n- Enables audience-submitted tips for
      queries not answered by the bot\n- Ties directly to a team’s Check database,
      allowing them to send previously fact-checked reports\n\nFor our partner organizations,
      the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, size
      the demand for specific topics, and distribute key information in close messaging
      networks. Through building this relations, it is also the  opportunity to develop
      interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end-users to assess behavioural
      impacts of fact-checks.\n\n![phone bot](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/417goq4WmR29NxllRAvdDX/11677981cda6d5de9658ddfc6dc2dc9b/phone_bot.gif)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
      and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
      Twitter DM, and more.</p>\n\nWhen designing this bot, we worked with our fact-checking
      partners to ensure the following principles were met:\n\n- __Audience development:__
      Fact-checking teams have spent years cultivating trust with their audiences,
      and we wanted to make sure the bot supports this work. Teams can customize every
      interaction and content  that represents their unique voice. They can  continue
      to receive fact-check requests through the same tipline and communicate with
      their audiences directly.\n- __Ready for scale:__ We are testing the bot with
      teams that receive thousands of messages per week. The bot is designed to handle
      requests of many thousands more, automating frequently-requested content while
      overall improving the quality of tipline content submissions.\n- __Local content,
      local languages:__ This bot can provide more detailed content coverage for local
      audiences that complements the work of global health organizations and national
      health ministries. Fact-checking organizations can create custom resource responses
      for their end users that are context or language-specific, directly meeting
      a target population’s health information needs. Thanks to our partnership with
      the [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/), we can also localize
      the content and interface to relevant languages.\n\nRight now, we’re testing
      this bot with COVID-19 content and localized COVID-19 resources. Per our ongoing
      commitments to open source and the [Open COVID Pledge](https://meedan.com/blog/meedan-supports-the-open-covid-pledge/),
      it is also open source. The goal is to link this up with [Meedan’s COVID-19
      Expert Database](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/),
      developed by our [Digital Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/). This database
      contains contextualized health information developed and vetted by public health
      experts that can be used as source material in fact-checks, removing some of
      the challenges of accessing verified expert content  \n\nThe bot can be fully
      adapted for any kind of content, addressing audience queries related to  politics,
      science and breaking news events. We are planning to add more messaging services
      such as Lime, Telegram, Viber, Instagram and many more. \n\nInterested in a
      demo? Get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>.\n"

    body: "We were thrilled to hear that the focus of Tech & Check this year would
      be on projects matching speakers’ claims with previously published fact-checks
      and other related text and image matching efforts in service of fact-checking.
      Just as we didn’t anticipate that our main technical focus would be the subject
      of this year’s gathering, we didn’t suspect that our respective planned travel
      from the UK and Brazil for this year’s Tech & Check would be replaced with an
      opening night mixer via Zoom due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19
      crisis around the world. Regardless of the global pandemic, on April 3rd, journalists,
      engineers, computer scientists and other professionals met virtually to watch
      a few demos and discuss claim matching in the context of fact-checking.\n\nLast
      year at [Tech & Check](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/tech-check-cooperative-2019/),
      we presented [Check Message](https://meedan.com/check), an integration between
      Check (Meedan’s open source platform for collaborative fact-checking) and the
      [WhatsApp Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api), as a tool to
      deal with misinformation in closed message applications at scale. Just a few
      days after our presentation, the technology went live with [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/),
      an effort to monitor, verify, and conduct research on WhatsApp misinformation
      during the 2019 Indian Election led by Delhi-based media research and training
      organization [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/) and commissioned and technically assisted
      by WhatsApp. Check Message allows media partners to operate tip lines to which
      people can forward possibly misleading, miscontextualised, or false information
      they see to the partner for fact-checking. During the Indian Elections, PROTO
      received over 100,000 submissions from the public.\n\n![Caio Almeida presenting

      Media and Democracy, and photo by Colin Huth.</p>\n\n\nMany of those submissions
      were similar to other submissions, but at that time we just had the technology
      implemented to match identical submissions—text or images—so, many submissions
      that were similar but not identical had to be manually marked as such, which
      was uselessly costly. In order to optimize that process, we started to work
      on tools that could suggest similar items automatically to our users.\n \nWe
      were honored to be one of five organizations that demonstrated their work in
      this area. In our case, we demonstrated our current claim and image matching
      tools for fact-checkers, which integrate with our open-source software, Check.
      We developed an [open-source architecture](https://github.com/meedan/alegre)
      to use ElasticSearch to efficiently search language volumes of text items by
      their vector representations in near real-time and integrated this into Check.
      For Checkpoint, we used pre trained word vectors, but the architecture we developed
      is not specific to these choices and can easily be adapted to other vector-representation
      models and languages. We are now using the [Multilingual Universal Sentence
      Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04307), and are working to develop additional
      approaches to support even more of many languages our partners across the world
      use. For images, we are using perceptual hashing and evaluating newer approaches
      including [PDQ](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/master/hashing/pdq).\n
      \n![Architectural diagram of Check’s open source claim similarity framework](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/gOQBQqGPrtCPCbFHRm1Wy/710c99128eb87060be2846b0af5a8718/check-similarity-bot.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Architectural diagram of Check’s <a href=\"https://github.com/meedan/check\">open
      source</a> claim similarity framework</p>\n\n \nFor both images and text, Check
      users are able to define a set of similarity rules, which can relate items to
      be verified based on how similar they are. The user defines that minimum similarity
      threshold, which is a number between 0% and 100%, and if our image and text
      matching tool returns a similarity value equal or higher than that threshold,
      two items are related automatically. The idea is that we are able to optimize
      the fact-checking process by group similar items together rather than working
      on them separately. This also helps our partners better understand what content
      is most submitted to their tip lines. The video below demonstrates those features.\n\n<p
      class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTbTQGhPpu0?rel=0\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Video-demonstration
      of Check similarity tools, presented at Tech & Check 2020</p>\n\n\nThis was
      part of the discussion that followed the demos. In the afternoon, people interested
      and working on claim matching discussed the problem types we have ahead of us,
      and came up with three main branches: \n \nThe first one was obviously __claim
      matching and semantic text similarity__: the matching of a novel claim with
      previously checked claims to determine if there is a substantially similar previous
      claim. Potential solutions that were proposed include, for example, named entity
      overlap, vector representations, comparing with knowledge bases; categorization
      of previously made claims and comparison to a novel claim; and combinations
      of multiple approaches. \n \nThe second problem type was __human matching__.
      Pure computational fact checking is prone to mismatches, sometimes funny, sometimes
      truly detrimental. Where and how can human editors, crowdsourcing and other
      forms of human intervention be used to assist and mediate this system? One proposal
      for that is to have an editor as a final step in an otherwise computational
      pipeline. At Meedan, we’re trying to develop efficient human-in-the-loop approaches
      where we can finetune and improve our computational tools based on the standard
      actions users take while using Check. Every time users remove an automated match
      or add a manually match we gain valuable insights into the types of things that
      should and shouldn’t match. Over time, we want to use this data to evaluate
      new approaches and improve the existing approaches. In other words, we see the
      system more as a circle than a pipeline: our algorithms make suggestions and
      learn from users’ actions. \n \nThe third problem type we discussed was __image
      matching__, and we discussed solutions like different image hashing algorithms,
      object retrieval, object identification and information extraction from images.\n
      \nWe are excited to keep working on those problems and to contribute with the
      Tech & Check community, and we can’t wait to share more interesting insights
      and findings next year at Tech & Check."

    body: "### The 2020 Global Misinfodemic Report examines the impact of COVID-19
      outside of the Global North\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the 2020 Global
      Misinfodemic Report, a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information
      scholars, legal experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining
      the impacts of COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong
      Kong, Brazil and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts
      and journalists from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and
      fact-checking organizations, the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation
      into the way this unprecedented viral event is both reforming and confirming
      the state of our global information ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020,
      as countries worked to contain the first signs of the physical virus spreading,
      a secondary crisis occured: misinformation on platforms like Twitter, Facebook
      and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
      [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
      and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
      \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
      UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
      and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health
      advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the
      airwaves. Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going
      viral, stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against
      this disease, too.”\n\nA misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers
      in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
      and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
      leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
      interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
      approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report
      touches on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are
      spreading online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating
      with certain communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation
      on  public health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging
      economies?\n- What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe
      first wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed
      world, but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New
      York Times editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies
      ahead is the spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict,
      through packed refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh,
      through teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social
      distancing is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without
      the fiscal capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would
      be disastrous not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies
      of raw materials are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger
      and the virus doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely
      to ensue, long after countries in North America and Europe control their initial
      outbreaks, is sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about
      the pandemic. In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our
      partners’ fact-checking tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched
      COVID-19 misinformation evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments
      involving tea, vitamins, hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation
      about penalties for spreading misinformation or just spreading information,
      about the pandemic \n- Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this
      misinformation can trigger real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing
      the most obvious and harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where
