    body: "To read in Spanish, Portugeses, or Arabic.\n\nAs the World Health Organization
      (WHO) announced the [COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus. This is particularly challenging for civil society
      organisations and grassroots collectives who are still struggling to make sense
      of, and to counter the effects of, the outbreak on their own local contexts.
      \n\nIn an attempt to support independent media, fact-checkers, citizen journalists,
      activists, and technology and digital literacy enthusiasts in their efforts
      to cover the outbreak, Meedan's Check Global program is launching the COVID-19
      Microgrants, specifically aimed at groups working within the context of emerging
      economies (North Africa/West Asia, Africa, Latin America, Asia-Pacific region).
      \n\nThe grants are aimed at supporting fact-checking and verification projects,
      local watchdog initiatives, documentation of the local reality under quarantine,
      media/digital literacy campaigns, [tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/04/06/how-will-coronavirus-reshape-democracy-and-governance-globally-pub-81470),
      and examining [digital surveillance](https://www.eff.org/issues/covid-19) and
      [surveillance capitalism](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/covid-19-surveillance-threat-to-your-rights/),
      civil rights, and [violence against women related to COVID-19](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061132).
      We encourage applicants to be creative in their proposals. We  are keen to support
      the production of different kinds of outputs, including podcasts, videos, documentaries,
      written pieces, campaigns, toolkits, digital archives, and blogging. We are
      also looking to support proposals that are not only focused on covering misinformation
      about the pandemic, but also looking at people's lives and experiences under
      quarantine.\n\nWe are accepting proposals in English, Arabic, French, Spanish
      and Portuguese at the moment. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.
      \n\n- Individuals can apply for up to $500 \n- Organizations can apply for up
      to $2000\n- Collaborative projects can apply for up to $2500 \n\n### Application

      all applications\n3. Successful applicants are then notified within a period
      of 5 to 10 days from submission\n\n\n### Selection criteria\n\n- __Originality
      & significance:__ The quality of the written application. What are the challenges
      it suggests to address? What is its geographic area / focus?\n- __Achievability:__
      Will the applicant be able to deliver on the promises made in the application?
      Is the work plan realistic within the suggested timeline? Does the fieldwork
      represent any ethical or health and safety issues that need to be taken into
      consideration? \n- __Impact & Dissemination:__ Does the application identify
      a relevant audience for the work? How does the work set out to transform perception
      on COVID-19? Is the application clear in terms of why this work is important
      now? Projects that serve local and underserved communities, women, gender non-binary
      individuals, vulnerable people and rural populations will be prioritized.\n-
      __Rigour:__ Do you adhere to a fact-checking methodology? How will the applicant
      check their sources as accurate? Are the resources used for your media literacy
      campaign reliable?\n\nPlease be advised, if you haven’t heard from us within
      3 weeks of your application, this means it was not successful. Unfortunately
      we are not able to respond to each unsuccessful applicant due to the numbers
      of applications we receive.\n\nAccepted applicants will publish their projects
      on their own platforms and will be referenced on the Check Global page. They

      abre esta chamada para incentivos (micro-bolsas) com o objetivo de apoiar a
      alfabetização digital e a produção independente de mídia nas economias emergentes
      relacionado ao COVID-19. \n\nA Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) anunciou o
      surto de COVID-19, uma pandemia e uma crise global de saúde. As informações
      falsas e os rumores sobre saúde se multiplicaram entre as plataformas, minando
      os esforços para produzir informações confiáveis ​​e factuais em relação ao
      vírus. Isso é particularmente desafiador para as organizações da sociedade civil
      e coletivos de base que ainda lutam para entender e combater os efeitos do surto
      em seus próprios contextos locais.\n\nEm uma tentativa de apoiar meios de comunicação
      independentes, verificadores de fatos, jornalistas cidadãos, ativistas e entusiastas
      da tecnologia e da alfabetização digital em seus esforços para cobrir o surto,
      a Meedan está lançando COVID-19 Check Global, especificamente destinadas a grupos
      que trabalham dentro o contexto das economias emergentes (América Latina, Norte
      da África / Ásia Ocidental, África e a região Ásia-Pacífico).\n\nVisamos apoiar
      projetos de verificação e verificação de fatos, iniciativas locais de fiscalização,
      documentação da realidade local em campanhas de quarentena e de mídia/digital,
      rastreando o impacto dos bloqueios nas democracias e examinando a vigilância
      digital e o capitalismo de vigilância, direitos civis e violência contra mulheres
      relacionada ao COVID-19. \n\nIncentivamos os candidatos a serem criativos em
      suas propostas. Estamos interessados ​​em apoiar a produção de diferentes tipos
      de resultados, incluindo podcasts, vídeos, documentários, peças escritas, campanhas,
      kits de ferramentas, arquivos e memórias digitais e blogs. Também estamos procurando
      apoiar propostas que não sejam focadas apenas na cobertura de informações erradas
      sobre a pandemia, mas também na vida e nas experiências das pessoas em quarentena.\n\nEstamos
      aceitando propostas em português , árabe, francês, espanhol e inglês no momento.
      As propostas serão consideradas em uma base contínua.\n\nIndivíduos podem solicitar
      até US $ 500\nOrganizações podem solicitar até US $ 2000\nProjetos colaborativos
      podem solicitar até US $ 2500\n\n\n### __Processo de aplicação__\nOs candidatos

      dentro do cronograma sugerido? O trabalho de campo representa algum problema
      ético ou de saúde e segurança que precisa ser levado em consideração?\n\n__Impacto
      e divulgaçã__o: O candidato identifica um público relevante para o trabalho?
      Como o trabalho se propõe a transformar a percepção no COVID-19? O candidato
      \ está claro em termos de por que esse trabalho é importante agora? Serão priorizados
      projetos que atendam comunidades locais e carentes, mulheres, pessoas não binárias,
      pessoas vulneráveis ​​e populações rurais.\n\n__Rigor__: Você segue uma metodologia
      de verificação de fatos? Como o candidato verificará suas fontes como precisas?
      Os recursos utilizados para sua campanha de alfabetização de mídia são confiáveis?\n\nEsteja
      ciente de que, se você não receber uma resposta nossa dentro de três semanas

      العالمية أن فيروس كوفيد-19 وباءً وأزمةً صحيةً عالميةً، قد ازدادت المعلومات الصحية
      المُضللة والشائعات عبر منصات التواصل الاجتماعي، ممَّا أدى إلى تقويض الجهود المبذولة
      لنشر معلومات موثوقة وتم التحقق منها حول الفيروس. وينطوي هذا الأمر على تحدٍ خاص
      لمنظمات المجتمع المدني و التعاونيات والمجموعات الناشطة في مجال التكنولوجيا والتحقق
      من المعلومات التي تكافح من أجل فهم هذه الجائحة والتصدي لآثارها في سياقاتها المحلية.
      \n\nتطلق ميدان منح \"تشك جلوبال\" الصغيرة في محاولة منها لدعم الإعلاميين المستقلين
      ومدققي الحقائق والمواطنين الصحفيين والناشطين والعاملين في حقل التكنولوجيا والمعرفة
      الرقمية والتحقق من الأخبار في جهودهم الرامية إلى تغطية تفشي فيروس كوفيد-19 ،
      وتستهدف هذه المنح تحديداً المجموعات الناشطة في شمال أفريقيا وغرب آسيا، وأفريقيا،
      وأمريكا اللاتينية ومنطقة آسيا التي تطل على المحيط الهادئ.  \n\nوتهدف هذه المنح
      إلى دعم مشاريع تدقيق الحقائق والتحقق من الأخبار والمعلومات ومبادرات المراقبة
      المحلية وتوثيق يوميات الواقع المحلي  للمجتمعات الخاضعة للحجر الصحي وحملات التربية
      الإعلامية والرقمية وتعقب أثر منع التجول على الأنظمة الديمقراطية، وفحص تأثير
      الجائحة على آليات المراقبة التقنية، ورأسمالية المراقبة والحقوق المدنية والعنف
      ضد المرأة فيما يتعلق بفيروس كوفيد-19. وبالتالي، فإننا نشجع المتقدمين على الإبداع
      في مقترحاتهم. وإننا حريصون على دعم إنتاج أنواع مختلفة من المشروعات بما فيها
      البودكاست (البث الصوتي الرقمي) والفيديوهات والوثائقيات والمؤلفات والحملات ومجموعات
      الأدوات والأرشيفات الرقمية والتدوين. كما نتطلع إلى دعم المقترحات التي لا تركز
      فقط على تغطية المعلومات المضللة حول الجائحة، بل أيضاً النظر في حياة الناس وتجاربهم
      أثناء الحجر الصحي.\n\nنحن حالياً نقبل مقترحات بالعربية والإنجليزية والفرنسية
      والإسبانية والبرتغالية. وسيتم النظر في الطلبات بشكل دوري. . \n\n\nيُمكن للأفراد
      التقدم بطلب حتى 500 دولار. \nيُمكن للمنظمات التقدم بطلب حتى 2000 دولار.\nيُمكن
      للمشاريع الجماعية التقدم بطلب حتى 2500 دولار. \n\n\n### عملية تقديم الطلبات\n\n\nينبغي

      المكتوب. ما التحديات التي يقترح معالجتها؟ ما منطقته الجغرافية/تركيزه الجغرافي؟\n__قابلية
      التحقيق__: هل سيكون المتقدم قادراً على الإيفاء بوعوده المذكورة في الطلب؟ هل
      خطة العمل واقعية في الإطار الزمني المُقترح؟ هل يُمثِّل العمل الميداني أي قضايا
      متعلقة بالأخلاق والصحة والسلامة لا بد من وضعها في عين الاعتبار؟  \n__الأثر والتعميم__:
      هل يحدد الطلب جمهوراً معنياً بالعمل؟ كيفية تخطيط العمل لتغيير التصور بشأن كوفيد-19؟
      هل الطلب واضح من حيث سبب أهمية هذا العمل الآن؟ سيتم إعطاء الأولوية للمشاريع
      التي تخدم المجتمعات المحلية والمجتمعات المحرومة والنساء والمجموعات ثنائية الجندر
      و الأقليات، وسكان الأقاليم .\n__الدقة__: هل ستلتزم بمنهجية تدقيق الحقائق؟ كيف
      سيتحقق المتقدم من دقة مصادره؟ هل المصادر المستخدمة في حملة التربية الإعلامية
      الخاصة بك تعد موثوقة؟\n\nالرجاء ملاحظة أنه إذا لم تتلق منا رداً خلال ثلاثة أسابيع
      من تاريخ تقديم طلبك، فهذا يعني أن طلبك غير موَّفق. ويؤسفنا القول بأنه لا يُمكننا
      على الرد على كل طلب غير موَّفق بسبب كمية الطلبات الكبيرة التي نتلقاها.  \n\nسيقوم
      المتقدمين المقبولين بنشر مشاريعهم على منصاتهم الخاصة وسيشار إليها أيضاً في صفحة
      \"تشيك جلوبال\". وسيتم إبرازها لاحقاً على مدونتنا في نهاية هذه الدورة التمويلية.

    body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
      massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
      support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
      researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
      a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
      and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
      infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material
      for journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize
      pandemic-related information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can
      present a bottleneck for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies,
      when demand for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the
      Harvard School of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have
      been researching how health information inequity and digital health misinformation
      can impact the spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps
      that can exacerbate those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care.
      \n\nIt is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic,
      that two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
      and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
      health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research
      and epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious
      disease researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively
      to a wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
      is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
      CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
      and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
      — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the
      second challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is
      supplying important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan
      to utilize ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate
      can be shared readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database
      into fact-checking bot workflows that many of our partners are already using
      to source questions from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to
      either access existing resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries
      to be fact-checked. This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations
      directly, and providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable
      initiatives being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health
      ministries around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality
      information through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative,
      Twitter, Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency
      and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered
      around six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access
      to experts can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities
      to access reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is
      populated and regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly
      sourced questions and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental
      health organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs
      during the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global
      network of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain
      the database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers
      and communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
      COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
      public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
      required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue
      to collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies
      and evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact
      assessment, monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design.
      In addition to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate
      to be working with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City
      University, as well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the
      behavioral impact of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database
      priorities and content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist
      COVID-19 response effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative
      \ to bridge research and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators.
      We are developing templates for packaged, verified content that can be included
      in outputs sent from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded
      in behavior science and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of
      care for communications, and include best practices for addressing health information
      response challenges, such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and
      transparency in the ever-changing information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__
      We are prioritizing pathways for disseminating contents of the database across
      languages to fact-checkers and pandemic communicators around the world. We are
      also integrating into Meedan’s open source verification and fact-checking workspace
      software, Check, in order to make its expert-reviewed contents available to
      the public. Through Check, we are creating an interface for users to design
      custom multilingual bots for disseminating their fact-checked content, connecting
      users to closed messaging networks including Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct
      Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then be able to access a subset of relevant
      resources, selected by each fact-checking organization individually, via a simple
      query system, and will be presented with short lists of up-to-date content that
      matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__ Through this project, we are examining
      the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions across languages and geographies,
      exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation, and translating findings
      into useful insights for public health communicators. In addition, as a group
      that works closely with partners in emerging economies, Meedan is closely following
      the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people living in densely populated
      urban areas and underserved communities that don't have access to public health
      care systems. Our team members in different regions are tracking the impact
      of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence against women, and insights
      will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. During this historic
      time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical questions about
      everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious disease research.
      Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer questions about
      complex health information, medical research and epidemiological findings, while
      public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers struggle to urgently
      communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The result of this problem
      set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor health outcomes,
      as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world spread of
      disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure on fact-checking
      organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience to health
      experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including research
      on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and the
      Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
      Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped
      much of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of
      Meedan’s Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal
      of promoting health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six
      years, these ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night
      dinners and graduate school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu
      brainstorming, in sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival,
      the Digital Health @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News
      Initiative Summits, in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics,
      mixed methods, and human rights lectures, and in conversations between friends
      and colleagues, hopeful in our ability to create something important together.
      I am immensely grateful to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make
      the most of our work together, and to all of our supporters as we further develop
      this intersection.\n\nThis COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without
      the partnership and collaboration of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural
      Insights Team, Birmingham City University, students and researchers from the
      Harvard School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
      and our network of public health specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this
      initiative, we are keen to learn and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity
      to contribute to the challenging and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators
      are doing to address this pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please
      reach out at health@meedan.com to talk more.\n"

    body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives
      is one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
      with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
      and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
      expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
      information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
      health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
      fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and
      time at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This
      ensures that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time.
      Including specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization
      hosts daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries
      may change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the
      exact point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2.
      Be context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
      For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
      about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
      to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only.
      This ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
      and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular
      treatments have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information
      you use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information
      you have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed
      to publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
      such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
      This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
      information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
      with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
      a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
      to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
      our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
      health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
      is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
      and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
      a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
      for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
      Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical
      recommendations to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with
      that. If there are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants
      answered, they can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:
      \ \n\n>   “If you're looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare
      provider, and   be sure to review the World Health Organization website for
      more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs
      the COVID-19 pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents
      and screens, drastically impacting public health, our way of life and global
      markets, Meedan is also reflecting on this historic moment and its emerging
      lessons: In the coming weeks we will be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19,
      written by journalists, fact-checkers, censorship experts, thought leaders and
      academics. The contributors are writing about the pandemic through the fog of
      the war— filing reports and analyses as news is still breaking, long before
      we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe analyses will aim to shine a
      light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship, localization of information
      access, and public trust, as we start to think about moving forward and away
      from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this in our newsletter and
      on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
      The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should
      not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized
      for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection
      is possible\"\n\n"

    body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
      of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
      ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
      to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso,
      and Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with
      newsrooms, fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three
      continents.\n\nThis represents significant growth from previous years, allowing
      us to deepen our support for these regions with program leads who are deeply
      familiar with their local contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our
      amazing partners around the world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional
      leads, along with Wafaa Heikal, our long-running program manager who is now
      heading up our efforts in Africa and the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini
      Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi is passionate about feminism and local journalism.
      Over the last two decades, her work has brought the two together. Shalini has
      studied misinformation, particularly on closed messaging platforms. She has
      been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/)
      ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)). The fellowship focused on designing creative
      ways to counter misinformation. As a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/),
      ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/)
      - a research project focused on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini
      started her professional journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/),
      a centre for gender education. She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented
      communities to come into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes.
      Shalini is the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/)
      (“News Waves” in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya
      is known for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women
      from some of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project
      is a testament to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent
      media is essential, as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini
      believes that [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can
      be a turning point for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation
      shared on closed messaging platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate,
      annotate, verify and archive misinformation and Shalini believes that for several
      small and independent newsrooms, this is a great service that no other platform
      currently provides. Check has tremendous potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers
      to design collaborative projects, especially around areas of common interest.
      Its unique features are great for large projects on politics, health, climate
      change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n### Meet Isabella Barroso
      in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa, is Meedan's Latin
      America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms in both Spanish
      and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's program team
      with a passion for human-centred design and product development that is fit
      to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design, Isa
      hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills in
      product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
      journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
      [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
      and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am
      now developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\"
      noted Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned
      a lot about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this
      happens with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America
      seems to be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging
      on closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
      overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
      Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in
      journalism. She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy
      to literature. \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with
      culture and social media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first
      job was as a culture journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
      due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
      came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
      of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
      I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
      open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
      the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
      media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
      with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news
      cycle. In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor
      and verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human
      rights researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
      annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
      open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support
      different workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate
      and what context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work
      across an interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with
      small teams and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring
      projects, understanding the particular national context and partner capacities
      and then designing new workflows around them.”\n\n"

    body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
      we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
      is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
      is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
      two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you
      have water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
      economies where most of the population live in urban dense areas the outcome
      of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to remember the power
      we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create new and inclusive
      pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts as a speaker and
      as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon in México, which
      occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n\"Cambiar el medio
      empieza por cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media we will need to start changing
      it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO of Chicas Poderosas, at
      the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This speech set the tone for
      the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas an all-female digital
      journalism network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn a historic building at the center
      of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican states got together for two days with
      the goal of creating multimedia projects on subjects relevant to their context
      and based on the current sexual assaults occurring in the country. \n\nTo get
      to this meeting spot you would have to first find yourself on a street right
      behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic church that is part of a series
      of buildings that stand today on top of what used to be The Templo Mayor, the
      heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event started, the women took pictures
      first of the stage and the speakers, but slowly as they started to chat with
      each other during the activities of the day, selfies emerged— a prelude to the
      professional relationships and friendships that were forged at these events.
      Despite the grey building, colors were abundant in Chicas banners, participant's
      hairs, pañuelos and children's toys. \n\nA little girl was  running between
      the participants' tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with
      her mother's camera. A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced
      and taken care of by the community. In Latin America there is an increasing
      number of women self identifying as household heads, and as they become mothers
      the participation in professional events declines, as do career development
      opportunities. This effect is known as the baby penalty. The presence of kids
      in this event set a precedent for Chicas, and in 2020 all Mediathons will make
      clear in their calls to the community that mothers and children are welcome.
      \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those of a call for
      action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist spaces,
      and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was composed
      of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers, and journalists.
      All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of diverse personalities:
      a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\nTo ensure that the
      room was transformed into a safe space, rules of behavior and engagement were
      shared as soon as the event began. Chicas defines a safe a place as one that
      is free of social, cultural, racial and sexual oppression. The material with
      the code of conduct was sent to the participants beforehand, and they were reminded
      by the organizers that they were always available to answer any questions and
      to help if something that violated the code or made them feel uncomfortable
      happened. A few members were defined as the go-to people for any woman that
      felt the code was violated. There were only a few men present, of those, most
      were working at the catering service and only a couple representing NGOs that
      were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons models are only possible because
      Chicas has volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in which  they run an
      event. The team organizing it was composed of members that first started by
      attending or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around Latin America,
      which is a common way to get to know and be a part of the community. In this
      case, most of them were not from México City and had instead traveled from distant
      provinces. \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered around a
      contextualized issue, in this case, violence against women in México. The first
      segment involved local NGOs and communities presenting their work on gender
      violence, violence against women journalists, abortion and reproductive rights.
      After that, the participants decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate
      further, and teams formed around the multimedia projects. On the second day,
      \ women leaders in their field presented issues on which they are experts, such
      as online engagement, online security, and fact-checking tools (this last one
      was presented by a zombie-like me while I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX
      dry climate). After this, they worked on the projects with their mentors and
      at the end presented their multimedia projects and timelines.\n\nThe highlight
      of this experience was when one of the participants started presenting her project
      in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped, shouted and, safe to say, I had
      goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that systematically erased (and still
      does) the existence of the indigenous population, it was humbling to hear that
      ancient and important language. That woman speaking summed to me what Chicas
      is about: giving and saving space for underrepresented voices that shape our
      communities. \n\nThe projects presented were about a myriad of subjects: abortion,
      sexuality, a radio community directed to indigenous women focusing on fighting
      gender violence in 6 different local languages, child and teenage pregnancies,
      masculinity and gender roles. \n\nHere you can check out the amazing work that
      was published after the one-month mentoring program:\n\n- [Forced maternity:
      pregnancies in girls and adolescents show the other side of violence against
      women in Mexico](https://serendipia.digital/2020/01/embarazo-adolescente-muestra-la-otra-cara-de-la-violencia-contra-las-mujeres-en-mexico/
      \"Link to artcile about forced maternity in Mexico\")\n- [Women on community
      radio](https://ladobe.com.mx/2020/01/las-mujeres-en-las-radios-comunitarias/
      \"Link to article about women presence in community radios in Mexico\")\n- [Women
      journalists under two fires: gender and sociopolitical violence ](https://distintaslatitudes.net/historias/reportaje/mujeres-periodistas-bajo-dos-fuegos
      \"Link to article about women journalists facing different types of violence\")\n\nLooking
      at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
      in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is
      working on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate,
      sustain and expand their community using digital tools. \n\nMuch of Chicas activities
      in 2020 will be focuses on COVID-19  \n\nAt Meedan we are working to bring much
      of our offline programming into digital spaces in even stronger ways. We look
      forward to learning from Chicas and sharing best practices for this new reality
      we face.\n\n\n\n"
