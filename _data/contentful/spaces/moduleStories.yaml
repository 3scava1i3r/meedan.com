        Reboot's Masterclass</a>.

    body: "This past Wednesday, three Meedanis had a chance to attend The Reboot’s
      Masterclass on “[Designing Collaborations for Urgent, Courageous Change](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/),”
      a 1.5-hour session on cross-sector collaboration. We will be sharing our team's
      insights for the other two sessions of this webinar series. \n\nAs the workshop
      describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse coalitions to
      advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts must draw on
      the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our activists,
      the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence of our
      media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the private
      sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work at the
      intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists, academics, policy
      researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale, and
      so this is a topic close to our heart. Here are three things we learned from
      speakers [Panthea Lee, Founder and Executive Director of The Reboot](https://reboot.org/team/panthea-lee/)
      and [Chelsey Lepage, Associate Director of Programs](https://reboot.org/team/chelsey-lepage/):\n\n__Program
      and initiative design can look like agile product development, starting with
      the problem and people.__\n\nFocus on the problem first, invite fewer subject
      matter experts to the table and more the people that need the solution. Chelsey
      Lepage suggested framing the problem as a hunch to make everyone collaborating
      more comfortable when giving inputs. It was insightful to see design and product
      development concepts applied to program work in such a clear manner.\n\nIn agile
      product development, defining a good problem statement is always a challenge,
      and if it is not well-crafted, the user need (solution) will be unmet. Making
      sure the team and users are involved in the framing is the key. Otherwise, all
      those hours spent on meetings, coding and design will have resulted in something
      —  in this context, an initiative — that will never be used. \n\nDuring the
      webinar, other concepts drew on that shared parallel such as “success criteria''.
      Knowing what criteria must be met so it is considered a success and how you
      will measure and identify it is also a core part of the product development
      cycle. They are embedded in the user stories, so every feature built brings
      value and is solving a user need. In program design this was presented in the
      same way: how will you know that an objective in your program was met? What
      will success look like? The Reboot’s webinar made clear that such as it is in
      product development, a fruitful initiative design is impossible without true
      collaboration.\n\n— *Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America*\n\n__When
      developing a collaboration, work on building relationships before focusing on
      the technical challenges you hope to address together.__\n\nWhen launching or
      developing a collaboration, the webinar leads emphasized the importance of thinking
      about collaborations as ongoing journeys, with interpersonal relationships to
      develop and strengthen before technical challenges become the focus. Presenters
      emphasized that this happens with multiple touchpoints to strengthen the collaboration,
      to build social cohesion, and to have “conversations as humans first, and as
      representatives of an organization second”. As organizations work to develop
      strong and long-term collaborations, the webinar emphasized that relationship
      building early on can help strengthen the interpersonal accountability that
      can help with achieving success as a team. \n\nOver the last decade, Meedan
      has prioritized the development of a global community of contributors and collaborators,
      working together to build impactful projects at the intersection of information
      equity and accessibility, global journalism and digital literacy. This webinar
      emphasized an important value that we as an organization hold dear: as we continue
      to develop collaborations to address the pressing global challenges of today,
      we’re committed to centralizing the focus on all forms of expertise, ensuring
      that all stakeholders are part of collaboration design, and strengthening the
      foundational relationships that enable success and maximize the impact we can
      realize together. \n\n— *Nat Gyenes, Senior Program Manager and Lead, Digital
      Health Lab*\n\n__Living Expertise is a valuable form of expertise that’s often
      overlooked in favor of formal training and education.__\n\nThe webinar discussed
      the concept of Living Experts, defined as those who “understand the lived experience
      of a problem or context.” These experts sit alongside a diversity of perspectives
      in cross-sector collaboration, such as technical experts, decision makers, implementers
      and allies. “Take an expensive view of ‘expertise’,” noted the webinar leaders.
      At Check Global and in [Meedan programs](https://meedan.com/projects) overall,
      we aim to center different forms of expertise, and this framework made a lot
      of sense for how we try to implement our initiatives.\n\n— *Mina Xiao, Operations*"

    body: "The bot, which also works on other social messaging platforms, is designed
      to scale response through the COVID crisis and other topical content.\n\nMeedan
      is pleased to roll out Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
      and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
      Twitter DM, and more. Now being tested in Brazil, India and across Africa with
      COVID-19 content, our bot is an extension of [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      our collaborative platform for digital media verification and annotation, to
      boost the work of human journalists through AI-powered claims matching, smart
      menus, and the ability to source new content directly from users for fact-checking.\n\nIt
      has the following key features:\n\n- A fully customizable interaction scenario
      , allowing fact-checking teams to spin up interactive menus of frequently-requested
      content to react to events rapidly  \n- Enables audience-submitted tips for
      queries not answered by the bot\n- Ties directly to a team’s Check database,
      allowing them to send previously fact-checked reports\n\nFor our partner organizations,
      the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, size
      the demand for specific topics, and distribute key information in close messaging
      networks. Through building this relations, it is also the  opportunity to develop
      interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end-users to assess behavioural
      impacts of fact-checks.\n\n![phone bot](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/417goq4WmR29NxllRAvdDX/11677981cda6d5de9658ddfc6dc2dc9b/phone_bot.gif)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
      and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
      Twitter DM, and more.</p>\n\nWhen designing this bot, we worked with our fact-checking
      partners to ensure the following principles were met:\n\n- __Audience development:__
      Fact-checking teams have spent years cultivating trust with their audiences,
      and we wanted to make sure the bot supports this work. Teams can customize every
      interaction and content  that represents their unique voice. They can  continue
      to receive fact-check requests through the same tipline and communicate with
      their audiences directly.\n- __Ready for scale:__ We are testing the bot with
      teams that receive thousands of messages per week. The bot is designed to handle
      requests of many thousands more, automating frequently-requested content while
      overall improving the quality of tipline content submissions.\n- __Local content,
      local languages:__ This bot can provide more detailed content coverage for local
      audiences that complements the work of global health organizations and national
      health ministries. Fact-checking organizations can create custom resource responses
      for their end users that are context or language-specific, directly meeting
      a target population’s health information needs. Thanks to our partnership with
      the [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/), we can also localize
      the content and interface to relevant languages.\n\nRight now, we’re testing
      this bot with COVID-19 content and localized COVID-19 resources. Per our ongoing
      commitments to open source and the [Open COVID Pledge](https://meedan.com/blog/meedan-supports-the-open-covid-pledge/),
      it is also [open source](https://github.com/meedan/check). The goal is to link
      this up with [Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/),
      developed by our [Digital Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/). This database
      contains contextualized health information developed and vetted by public health
      experts that can be used as source material in fact-checks, removing some of
      the challenges of accessing verified expert content  \n\nThe bot can be fully
      adapted for any kind of content, addressing audience queries related to politics,
      science and breaking news events. We are planning to add more messaging services
      such as Lime, Telegram, Viber, Instagram and many more. \n\nInterested in a

    body: "We were thrilled to hear that the focus of Tech & Check this year would
      be on projects matching speakers’ claims with previously published fact-checks
      and other related text and image matching efforts in service of fact-checking.
      Just as we didn’t anticipate that our main technical focus would be the subject
      of this year’s gathering, we didn’t suspect that our respective planned travel
      from the UK and Brazil for this year’s Tech & Check would be replaced with an
      opening night mixer via Zoom due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19
      crisis around the world. Regardless of the global pandemic, on April 3rd, journalists,
      engineers, computer scientists and other professionals met virtually to watch
      a few demos and discuss claim matching in the context of fact-checking.\n\nLast
      year at [Tech & Check](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/tech-check-cooperative-2019/),
      we presented [Check Message](https://meedan.com/check), an integration between
      Check (Meedan’s open source platform for collaborative fact-checking) and the
      [WhatsApp Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api), as a tool to
      deal with misinformation in closed message applications at scale. Just a few
      days after our presentation, the technology went live with [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/),
      an effort to monitor, verify, and conduct research on WhatsApp misinformation
      during the 2019 Indian Election led by Delhi-based media research and training
      organization [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/) and commissioned and technically assisted
      by WhatsApp. Check Message allows media partners to operate tip lines to which
      people can forward possibly misleading, miscontextualised, or false information
      they see to the partner for fact-checking. During the Indian Elections, PROTO
      received over 100,000 submissions from the public.\n\n![Caio Almeida presenting

      Media and Democracy, and photo by Colin Huth.</p>\n\n\nMany of those submissions
      were similar to other submissions, but at that time we just had the technology
      implemented to match identical submissions—text or images—so, many submissions
      that were similar but not identical had to be manually marked as such, which
      was uselessly costly. In order to optimize that process, we started to work
      on tools that could suggest similar items automatically to our users.\n \nWe
      were honored to be one of five organizations that demonstrated their work in
      this area. In our case, we demonstrated our current claim and image matching
      tools for fact-checkers, which integrate with our open-source software, Check.
      We developed an [open-source architecture](https://github.com/meedan/alegre)
      to use ElasticSearch to efficiently search language volumes of text items by
      their vector representations in near real-time and integrated this into Check.
      For Checkpoint, we used pre trained word vectors, but the architecture we developed
      is not specific to these choices and can easily be adapted to other vector-representation
      models and languages. We are now using the [Multilingual Universal Sentence
      Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04307), and are working to develop additional
      approaches to support even more of many languages our partners across the world
      use. For images, we are using perceptual hashing and evaluating newer approaches
      including [PDQ](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/master/hashing/pdq).\n
      \n![Architectural diagram of Check’s open source claim similarity framework](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/gOQBQqGPrtCPCbFHRm1Wy/710c99128eb87060be2846b0af5a8718/check-similarity-bot.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Architectural diagram of Check’s <a href=\"https://github.com/meedan/check\">open
      source</a> claim similarity framework</p>\n\n \nFor both images and text, Check
      users are able to define a set of similarity rules, which can relate items to
      be verified based on how similar they are. The user defines that minimum similarity
      threshold, which is a number between 0% and 100%, and if our image and text
      matching tool returns a similarity value equal or higher than that threshold,
      two items are related automatically. The idea is that we are able to optimize
      the fact-checking process by group similar items together rather than working
      on them separately. This also helps our partners better understand what content
      is most submitted to their tip lines. The video below demonstrates those features.\n\n<p
      class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTbTQGhPpu0?rel=0\"
      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Video-demonstration
      of Check similarity tools, presented at Tech & Check 2020</p>\n\n\nThis was
      part of the discussion that followed the demos. In the afternoon, people interested
      and working on claim matching discussed the problem types we have ahead of us,
      and came up with three main branches: \n \nThe first one was obviously __claim
      matching and semantic text similarity__: the matching of a novel claim with
      previously checked claims to determine if there is a substantially similar previous
      claim. Potential solutions that were proposed include, for example, named entity
      overlap, vector representations, comparing with knowledge bases; categorization
      of previously made claims and comparison to a novel claim; and combinations
      of multiple approaches. \n \nThe second problem type was __human matching__.
      Pure computational fact checking is prone to mismatches, sometimes funny, sometimes
      truly detrimental. Where and how can human editors, crowdsourcing and other
      forms of human intervention be used to assist and mediate this system? One proposal
      for that is to have an editor as a final step in an otherwise computational
      pipeline. At Meedan, we’re trying to develop efficient human-in-the-loop approaches
      where we can finetune and improve our computational tools based on the standard
      actions users take while using Check. Every time users remove an automated match
      or add a manually match we gain valuable insights into the types of things that
      should and shouldn’t match. Over time, we want to use this data to evaluate
      new approaches and improve the existing approaches. In other words, we see the
      system more as a circle than a pipeline: our algorithms make suggestions and
      learn from users’ actions. \n \nThe third problem type we discussed was __image
      matching__, and we discussed solutions like different image hashing algorithms,
      object retrieval, object identification and information extraction from images.\n
      \nWe are excited to keep working on those problems and to contribute with the
      Tech & Check community, and we can’t wait to share more interesting insights
      and findings next year at Tech & Check."
