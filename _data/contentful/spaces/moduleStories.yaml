    body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives
      is one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
      with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
      and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
      expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
      information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
      health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
      fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and
      time at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This
      ensures that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time.
      Including specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization
      hosts daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries
      may change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the
      exact point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2.
      Be context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
      For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
      about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
      to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only.
      This ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
      and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular
      treatments have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information
      you use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information
      you have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed
      to publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
      such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
      This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
      information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
      with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
      a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
      to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
      our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
      health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
      is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
      and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
      a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
      for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
      Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical
      recommendations to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with
      that. If there are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants
      answered, they can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:
      \ \n\n>   “If you're looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare
      provider, and   be sure to review the World Health Organization website for
      more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs
      the COVID-19 pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents
      and screens, drastically impacting public health, our way of life and global
      markets, Meedan is also reflecting on this historic moment and its emerging
      lessons: In the coming weeks we will be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19,
      written by journalists, fact-checkers, censorship experts, thought leaders and
      academics. The contributors are writing about the pandemic through the fog of
      the war— filing reports and analyses as news is still breaking, long before
      we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe analyses will aim to shine a
      light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship, localization of information
      access, and public trust, as we start to think about moving forward and away
      from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this in our newsletter and
      on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
      The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should
      not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized
      for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection
      is possible\"\n\n"

    body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
      of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
      ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
      to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso,
      and Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with
      newsrooms, fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three
      continents.\n\nThis represents significant growth from previous years, allowing
      us to deepen our support for these regions with program leads who are deeply
      familiar with their local contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our
      amazing partners around the world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional
      leads, along with Wafaa Heikal, our long-running program manager who is now
      heading up our efforts in Africa and the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini
      Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi is passionate about feminism and local journalism.
      Over the last two decades, her work has brought the two together. Shalini has
      studied misinformation, particularly on closed messaging platforms. She has
      been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/)
      ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)). The fellowship focused on designing creative
      ways to counter misinformation. As a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/),
      ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/)
      - a research project focused on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini
      started her professional journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/),
      a centre for gender education. She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented
      communities to come into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes.
      Shalini is the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/)
      (“News Waves” in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya
      is known for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women
      from some of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project
      is a testament to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent
      media is essential, as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini
      believes that [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can
      be a turning point for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation
      shared on closed messaging platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate,
      annotate, verify and archive misinformation and Shalini believes that for several
      small and independent newsrooms, this is a great service that no other platform
      currently provides. Check has tremendous potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers
      to design collaborative projects, especially around areas of common interest.
      Its unique features are great for large projects on politics, health, climate
      change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n### Meet Isabella Barroso
      in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa, is Meedan's Latin
      America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms in both Spanish
      and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's program team
      with a passion for human-centred design and product development that is fit
      to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design, Isa
      hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills in
      product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
      journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
      [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
      and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am
      now developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\"
      noted Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned
      a lot about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this
      happens with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America
      seems to be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging
      on closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
      overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
      Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in
      journalism. She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy
      to literature. \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with
      culture and social media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first
      job was as a culture journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
      due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
      came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
      of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
      I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
      open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
      the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
      media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
      with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news
      cycle. In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor
      and verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human
      rights researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
      annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
      open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support
      different workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate
      and what context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work
      across an interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with
      small teams and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring
      projects, understanding the particular national context and partner capacities
      and then designing new workflows around them.”\n\n"

    body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work
      remotely most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity
      for journalists, fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of
      COVID–19, the novel coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences
      focusing on Internet freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      the project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
      from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
      Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in
      COVID-19-related content, and  public health and science communication experts
      have been helping us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to
      ensure  accurate information can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate
      health information usually spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities
      at risk, but this year it’s more critical for us to accomplish what we usually
      do at conferences. While we are disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues
      in person, there’s an opportunity here. There have always been many reasons
      to have a virtual conference, but now there are more people and organizations
      motivated to do something about it - there are entire industries going virtual.
      At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity and inclusion amongst both staff
      and partners. If we work on this issue during a pandemic, we can make conferences
      more accessible for everyone as a long term goal too. Participants from emerging
      economies often have difficulty getting visas to attend conferences. Global
      climate change has led several people to forgo airplane travel. Parents have
      to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some disabilities make travel
      difficult, and the disability activism community has long called for improvements
      to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote participation has been used
      by several conferences to enable attendance for people who cannot travel. While
      this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual conferences are not widespread,
      and they lack virtual versions of useful conference activities. Many of the
      open source tools we use were designed by covering walls in a massive number
      of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What do you need from
      a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions? What works for
      you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe started with
      the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2. Presenting
      product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5. One-on-one
      discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7. Un-conference
      formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe came up
      with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked at
      were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
      budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
      high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
      indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
      thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
      has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a
      disability, however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is
      not an option at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling.
      As long as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate
      with other participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant
      lives in a region or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection.
      Any virtual conference technology has to take low bandwidth environments into
      account.\n\n3. This participant has a passport or legal status that makes it
      difficult for them to travel. They often get rejected for visas, even when they
      are a featured speaker at a conference. \n\n3. This participant lives in a country
      that censors the Internet and arrests journalists. In order to participate safely,
      they can only go to conferences with a no photo or video policy, whether this
      is a blanket ban or attendee preferences can be signaled by the color of their
      conference lanyard. Any virtual conference technology must allow private access,
      allowances for pseudonyms, participation without voice or video, and possibly
      compatibility with censorship circumvention technologies.\n\n4. This participant
      is Deaf. Their technology needs may include live captioning, participation by
      typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video of presenters to enable lip
      reading, or clear audio from participants depending on their level of hearing
      and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant is blind. Virtual
      conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers, and presenters
      should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of their presentation
      materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems understanding
      one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation, or
      just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
      participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the
      presentation. They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the
      ability to ask questions of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who
      need mobility aids face obstacles when traveling. Wheelchair users often get
      broken chairs back from airlines. When these chairs are custom fit, there are
      no temporary replacements that can make participating in a conference a pain-free
      experience. Power wheelchairs are very expensive, so travel can mean gambling
      with one’s mobility for a long time after a conference. \n\n9. This participant
      has modest tech skills and may need help with operating the interface for online
      meetings. Usability is an access issue. \n\nWe’re working with our communities
      to make lasting change out of this emergency situation. The civic tech community
      is evaluating software and practices for conferences and hackathons. We’re also
      expanding our online developer community. Let’s build something together! \n\nEmail
      us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a> to get started. "

    body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
      of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
      is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a
      global challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training
      sessions, host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and
      have network partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people,
      crossing borders, gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly
      global collaboration to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a
      global anti(in-person)-gathering. In Meedan terms: the future of our global
      town squares is dependent on our near term efforts to keep our physical town
      squares empty, and our digital town squares free of dangerous misinformation.
      \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic we are addressing the
      immediate needs of a global team and also working to develop programs that contribute
      to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing the lead of some other [inspiring
      organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
      \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and
      personal paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose
      school has been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members.
      We have closed our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have
      put a hold on the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.
      \  \n\nLast week we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support
      for their health and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans,
      budgets, and project timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent
      and encouragement of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development
      Cooperation Agency.  \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses.
      Last year we launched the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to
      health information as a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and
      Nat Gyenes framed some of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient
      piece in the Atlantic, [How Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
      \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous
      international bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable
      areas for civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with
      epidemiologists, public health communications experts, technology companies,
      and civil society partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository
      of annotated misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of
      our Check Global, Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies
      into this new program area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible
      threat to our emotional and physical well-being, I want to close this brief
      statement by saying perhaps this global project to stay apart might actually
      serve to bring together a world that is riven politically and ideologically.
      It’s going to take some brilliant and heroic collaborations to make it through
      the next several months and we are committed to doing what we can as an organization
      placed at the epicenter of misinformation response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist?
