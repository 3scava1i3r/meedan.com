    body: "This week, Meedan welcomes medical doctor and award-winning journalist,
      Dr. Seema Yasmin to our COVID-19 team. \n\nHer role will include sharing highlights
      from Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database, a new tool supported by major tech funders
      and foundations, which engages public health experts to provide newsworthy insights
      into complex pandemic science. \n\nYou’ll be able to find Dr. Yasmin’s highlights
      in our weekly newsletter, The Checklist, and on even more platforms soon. [Sign
      up](https://meedan.com/checklist) for the Checklist. To learn more about the
      COVID-19 Expert Database or to see how your newsroom or fact-checking organization
      can get involved, email <a href=\"health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.
      \n\n“Journalists are under immense pressure to report quickly, frequently, and
      accurately, during the pandemic,” said Dr. Yasmin. “That requires sifting through
      dozens of new studies published each day, analyzing complex methodology, and
      translating technical language into content for broad audiences — in addition
      to protecting the public from false narratives and dangerous myths spread by
      some politicians and bad actors. The Expert Database supports reporters and
      fact-checkers, helping them verify information so they can publish the kind
      of nuanced, accurate, and up-to-date content that the public demands during
      the global health crisis of our generation.\"\n\nEach week, Dr. Yasmin will
      curate key selections from the COVID-19 Expert Database and provide an added
      layer of context onto those pieces of information. This will help fact-checkers
      and journalists who use the COVID-19 Expert Database understand the most important
      content from around the world.\n\nDr. Yasmin is a physician-journalist who served
      as an officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention, before training as a journalist and reporting on the
      front lines of epidemics such as of Ebola, Zika, gun violence, and more. She
      trained in journalism at the University of Toronto and in medicine at the University
      of Cambridge. \n\nYasmin was [a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking
      news](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017) in 2017 with a team
      from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on
      neglected diseases. She has received two grants from the Pulitzer Center on
      Crisis Reporting and in 2017 she was selected as a John S. Knight Fellow in
      Journalism at Stanford University where she investigated the spread of health
      misinformation and disinformation during epidemics.\n\nWe are excited to work
      with Dr. Yasmin on amplifying these highlights to our audience. Stay tuned for
      more updates on the COVID-19 Expert Database soon, including more platforms
      for broadcasting highlights and an introduction to our entire team of experts.\n"

      description: A group of women with their hands raised during the 2019 Chicas

    body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
      we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
      is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
      is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
      two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you
      have water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
      economies where most of the population live in [urban dense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html)
      areas the outcome of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to
      remember the power we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create
      new and inclusive pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts
      as a speaker and as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon
      in México, which occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n>
      \"Para cambiar los medios necessitamos cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media
      we will need to change it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO
      of Chicas Poderosas, at the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This
      speech set the tone for the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas
      an all-female digital media professinals network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn
      a historic building at the center of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican
      states got together for two days with the goal of creating multimedia projects
      on subjects relevant to their context and based on the current sexual assaults
      occurring in the country. \n\nTo get to this meeting spot you would have to
      first find yourself on a street right behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic
      church that is part of a series of buildings that stand today on top of what
      used to be The Templo Mayor, the heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event
      started, the women took pictures first of the stage and the speakers, but slowly
      as they started to chat with each other during the activities of the day, selfies
      emerged— a prelude to the professional relationships and friendships that were
      forged at these events. Despite the grey building, colors were abundant in Chicas
      banners, participant's hairs, [pañuelos](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2019/06/08/color-por-color-que-significan-los-24-panuelos-que-se-venden-en-las-calles-portenas/)
      and children's toys. \n\n\nA little girl was running between the participants'
      tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with her mother's camera.
      A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced and taken care of
      by the community. In Latin America there is an increasing number of women self
      identifying as [household heads](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/unequal-family-lives/families-in-latin-america/27F2E01B797AD1489A238BFDF2075F1C/core-reader),
      and as they become mothers the participation in professional events declines,
      as do career development opportunities. This effect is known as the [baby penalty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813
      \"Baby Penalty\"). The presence of kids in this event set a precedent for Chicas,
      and in 2020 all Mediathons will make clear in their calls to the community that
      mothers and children are welcome *(due to COVID-19 pandemic Mediathons will
      be held online)*. \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those
      of a call for action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist
      spaces, and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was
      composed of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers,
      and journalists. All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of
      diverse personalities: a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\n###
      The Mediathon Model: Building a community by building safe spaces\n\nTo ensure
      that the room was transformed into a safe space, [rules of behavior ](http://chicaspoderosas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Co%CC%81digo-Chicas-ES.pdf
      \"Chicas Code of conduct\")and engagement were shared as soon as the event began.
      Chicas defines a safe a place as one that is free of social, cultural, racial
      and sexual oppression. The material with the code of conduct was sent to the
      participants beforehand, and they were reminded by the organizers that they
      were always available to answer any questions and to help if something that
      violated the code or made them feel uncomfortable happened. A few members were
      defined as the go-to people for any woman that felt the code was violated. There
      were only a few men present, of those, most were working at the catering service
      and only a couple representing NGOs that were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons
      are made real thanks to Chicas volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in
      which they run an event. The team organizing it was composed of members that
      first started by attending or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around
      Latin America, which is a common way to get to know and be a part of the community.
      In this case, most of them were not from México City and had instead traveled
      from distant provinces. \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered
      around a contextualized issue, in this case, violence against women in México.
      The first segment involved local NGOs and communities presenting their work
      on gender violence, violence against women journalists, abortion and reproductive
      rights. After that, the participants decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate
      further, and teams formed around the multimedia projects. On the second day,
      \ women leaders in their field presented issues on which they are experts, such
      as online engagement, online security, and fact-checking tools (this last one
      was presented by a zombie-like me while I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX
      dry climate). After this, they worked on the projects with their mentors and
      at the end presented their multimedia projects and timelines.\n\nThe highlight
      of this experience was when one of the participants started presenting her project
      in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped, shouted and, safe to say, I had
      goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that systematically erased (and still
      does) the existence of the indigenous population, it was humbling to hear that
      ancient and important language. That woman speaking summed to me what Chicas
      is about: sharing and saving space for underrepresented voices that shape our
      communities. \n\n### One-month mentoring projects\n\nThe projects presented
      were about a myriad of subjects: abortion, sexuality, a radio community directed
      to indigenous women focusing on fighting gender violence in 6 different local
      languages, child and teenage pregnancies, masculinity and gender roles. \n\n[Here](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/historias-que-ponen-nuestras-vocesenalza-ad1b31907010)

      at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
      in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is
      working on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate,
      sustain and expand their community using digital tools. This year one of the
      initiatives we will be supporting Chicas is the [Conversaciones Poderosas en
      La Pandemia COVID-19](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/conversacionespoderosas-en-la-pandemia-de-covid-19-71daa8ea523f
      \"Conversaciones Poderosas\"), a space to talk about the various challenges
      that the pandemic presents on a professional and personal level for journalists,
      share ideas on how to face them and exchange points of view from different countries.
      The objective is to create a space of containment, learning and accompaniment
      for the community."

    body: |-
      "I'm going to the grocery store asap," my friend texted me a few weeks ago, at the peak of the confusion around COVID-19 in the US. He'd heard word from a friend of a friend that President Trump was going to declare a nationwide quarantine. The text came through with urgency and authority --- the President was going to invoke the Stafford Act, the National Guard was going to be called in, and no one would be allowed outside their homes for two weeks.

      It wasn't true, but it felt true, and it felt especially true in the early morning hours when I got the message. I could feel in my bones a sense of dread --- wait, maybe this time it's real? California and New York were already shutting down. President Trump did declare a national emergency using the Stafford Act. There were indeed [credible recommendations from epidemiologists](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-13/coronavirus-shopping-list-your-essential-quarantine-items) that we stock up for two weeks in case we need to quarantine. And the [National Guard had already been called](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814164923/new-york-state-deploys-national-guard-to-manage-coronavirus-in-nyc-suburb) into a number of outbreak zones in the United States.

      The problem comes in the shades of gray: the Stafford Act does grant enormous powers to the President, but [national quarantine is not one of them](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/19/fact-check-does-stafford-act-allow-trump-order-quarantine/2872743001/). The National Guard has been deployed, not to enforce anything remotely resembling martial law but instead to help with [cleaning, testing and food delivery](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21188088/coronavirus-national-guard-testing-food-cleaning-martial). Cities and states have indeed issued shelter-in-place orders, but [the federal government doesn't have direct power](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/825293201/a-president-is-not-able-to-order-a-national-quarantine-experts-say) over these. Around the world, we're indeed  seeing national lockdowns in places like India, China and Hungary, with tremendous implications on civil rights. In this context, it might not be unreasonable to think that a military-enforced quarantine might be coming for the United States.

      [A recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-text-messages-national-quarantine.html) pointed out that false and misleading information is part of an ongoing problem in the wake of the pandemic: "With the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the world, misinformation has followed suit," the article noted. It continues:

      Other [SMS] messages in recent weeks, reflecting the same pattern, have warned that New York City public transit would shut down last week (it's still running), or that the entire Pacific Northwest would be quarantined last week (also not true). At least one message said that President Trump would declare a national emergency within three days --- Mr. Trump declared the emergency on Friday, but that did not give him the power to impose a national quarantine.

      ![Meedan sms 2](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/Qad98m6x2PoDGg9WD0DaW/91f2f80e2539ad70eec5389dd59470c6/Meedan_sms_2.png)

      Over the past year, the misinformation research community has been sounding the alarm about deepfakes, [a form of synthetic media](https://lab.witness.org/projects/synthetic-media-and-deep-fakes/) (i.e., media made by artificial intelligence) wherein people are made to look like they're saying or doing something that they're not. In January of this year, as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was spreading across China and --- as we would later learn --- much of the world, [Facebook announced a ban on AI-generated videos](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-us-election). That same month, [William A. Galston at the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-seeing-still-believing-the-deepfake-challenge-to-truth-in-politics/) warned that "If AI is reaching the point where it will be virtually impossible to detect audio and video representations of people saying things they never said (and even doing things they never did), seeing will no longer be believing, and we will have to decide for ourselves---without reliable evidence---whom or what to believe."

      Galston wrote these words with an eye on the upcoming 2020 election in the US, but just a few months later, the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly placed the US election into the background of national conversations. Furthermore, the misinformation thriving now is not deepfakes but cheap fakes --- what [Data & Society researchers Britt Paris and Joan Donovan](https://datasociety.net/library/deepfakes-and-cheap-fakes/) define as "an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing." Cheap fakes can simply be miscontextualized videos, like one going viral on [WhatsApp purportedly showing panicked mobs in the Netherlands](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/03/13/monitoring-and-debunking-covid-19-panic-the-haarlem-aldi-hoax/). 

      But much of today's pandemic misinformation is proving to be even simpler: what I call text fakes --- the oldest form of media manipulation, made possible by the ability to put words on a page, or a screen, or spread it around rapidly on private messaging apps. 

      The text fake goes back to the days of scrolls and pamphlets. [The ancient Romans engaged in information combat](https://www.ft.com/content/aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6), using the literary implements of their time to spread disinformation and confusion. But it was the rise of moveable type in the 15th century that soon yielded pamphleteering as a popular medium for politics. As such, they became an early source of text fakes: "Cheap and made on the smallest sheets of paper," noted [one article in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-we-solved-fake-news-the-first-time), "pamphlets were written for attention and money. How do you get attention? Then, as now, successful strategies included exaggeration and hating others (in the pamphlets' case, Catholics). Elaborate conspiracy theories were popular, too." Essayist and pamphleteer Jonathan Swift famously observed that "falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after." 

      Much of the deepfake discussion in 2019 focused lagely on the content of synthetic media --- what the media shows, how to detect it, what it might say, how it might mislead. Cheap fakes and text fakes floating around private messaging apps and public social media are, alternatively, a reminder of the importance of the context of media --- the mental state of the recipient, the narrative discourse in media and the general public, the relationship between the person sending the message and the person(s) receiving it, the political situation in the region, and a variety of other factors that influence how we interpret a piece of content, whether it's a piece of text or a fully-manipulated video.

      The history of writing suggests that as more people gain access to writing tools and the ability to manipulate the written word, the more we see misinformation in text. We should expect the same of video, with the rise of video editing tools and synthetic media. Beware the text fake --- it's a powerful reminder that when content flies around the internet, our understanding of its context still comes limping after.

    body: "As global journalism grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of challenges
      to press freedom remain. But the crisis also presents an opportunity to reimagine
      media in a post COVID-19 world. In time with World Press Fredom Day, we are
      launching our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/),
      our community for non-profits and collectives working in the area of independent
      media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) in emerging economies.\n\nWith
      our mission to support global journalism, Meedan cares deeply about press freedom
      around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenges we’ve been
      monitoring and writing about through our [Checklist](https://meedan.com/checklist)
      newsletter. Some of the trends we’ve seen are deeply concerning:\n\n### Journalists
      are on the frontlines of the pandemic\nJournalists have been on the frontlines
      reporting the pandemic in different regions. Reporters have been going to hospitals
      and other hotspots where the risk of exposure to the virus and infection is
      very high. Several media outlets do not have or cannot provide proper personal
      protective equipment (PPE) for their staff. According to the [Committee for
      the Protection of Journalists (CPJ), there is risk of the pandemic impacting
      journalists’ physical health and psychological well-being](https://cpj.org/blog/2020/04/qa-us-photographers-navigate-a-new-reality-under-c.php).
      \ \n\n### Media jobs are facing historic losses\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not
      only exposed media workers to physical vulnerabilities, it has also decimated
      an already battered media sector, with many companies reducing hours, holding
      back salaries or simply sacking their media staff outright, according to the
      [South Asia Press Freedom Report](https://samsn.ifj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/States-of-Control-IFJ-SAPFR-2019-20.pdf).
      Shrinking revenue from advertisements, serious disruptions in circulation of
      newspapers and printed publications and a severe strain on limited revenues
      have resulted in a job crisis where reporters and journalists across the world
      are [experiencing pay cuts, reduced hiring and layoffs](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/here-are-the-newsroom-layoffs-furloughs-and-closures-caused-by-the-coronavirus/).
      \ \n\n### Democracies are undermining press freedom\n[Over the last two and
      a half months, the International Press Institute’s (IPI) COVID-19 tracker has
      documented a total of 162 different press freedom violations related to the
      coronavirus](https://ipi.media/covid19-media-freedom-monitoring/). These range
      from verbal or physical attacks on journalists to arrests, restrictions on access
      to information and media censorship. This has created a hostile and challenging
      environment for independent media and press freedom. Several agencies also note
      that the current pandemic has given states an opportunity to exercise greater
      control over the media. IPI has also documented 16 cases of ‘fake news’ laws
      either being passed with disproportionate penalties or used to take down content
      about the virus online. IPI notes that while some of these laws are sincere
      but ill-conceived, others appear to deliberately strengthen authoritarian regimes’
      arsenal against the press.\n \n### Local journalism is under threat\nDuring
      a pandemic, people need timely, reliable and unbiased news on local conditions,
      however, the absence of sustainable and robust business models and distribution
      networks for local news is making that increasingly difficult. [These newsrooms
      will have to make strategic shifts in their business models in order to survive
      the pandemic](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/how-local-news-can-survive-and-thrive-during-the-pandemic/).
      \n\n### Journalists grapple with misinformation during a pandemic\nIn times
      of a global pandemic, access to accurate and unbiased information about the
      disease becomes ever more important. It is critical for the media to share verified
      and reliable information. However, the widespread use of social media and other
      platforms to share unverified information, often without scientific proof, can
      be dangerous and life threatening in the current situation. [UN chief António
      Guterres noted](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity)
      that \"the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading,\" using a word coined by Meedan
      researchers.  [UNESCO is promoting two social media campaigns “to fight the
      infodemic of rumours and disinformation”](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373354_eng.locale=en).
      UNESCO has also created a COVID- 19 resource centre for media. This online platform
      aims to help journalists track false information regarding the pandemic and
      report on the crisis reliably and effectively, as encouraged by the theme of
      World Press Freedom Day 2020, “journalism without fear or favour”.\n\nAt the
      same time, as [Meedan board member Maria Ressa wrote recently](https://time.com/5820620/maria-ressa-coronavirus-democracy/),
      “The mission of independent journalism has never been as important as it is
      today, when decisions are being made without transparency. Now more than ever,
      facts matter. Truth matters. Checks and balances matter.” It’s vital that those
      working for media freedom around the world come together to re-envision what
      this can look like.\n\nIn time with World Press Freedom Day, Meedan is thrilled
      to launch our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
      The network is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
      working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
      (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin
      America (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA).\n\nOur partners
      from different regions will participate in the launch of the Check Global Network
      this week. The network will provide its members access to opportunities and
      forums for sharing, learning and reflection. The main activities will focus
      on capacity building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational
      development, providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be
      part of a growing impactful community."

    body: "This past Wednesday, three Meedanis had a chance to attend The Reboot’s
      Masterclass on “[Designing Collaborations for Urgent, Courageous Change](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/),”
      a 1.5-hour session on cross-sector collaboration. We will be sharing our team's
      insights for the other two sessions of this webinar series. \n\nAs the workshop
      describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse coalitions to
      advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts must draw on
      the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our activists,
      the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence of our
      media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the private
      sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work at the
      intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists, academics, policy
      researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale, and
      so this is a topic close to our heart. Here are three things we learned from
      speakers [Panthea Lee, Founder and Executive Director of The Reboot](https://reboot.org/team/panthea-lee/)
      and [Chelsey Lepage, Associate Director of Programs](https://reboot.org/team/chelsey-lepage/):\n\n__Program
      and initiative design can look like agile product development, starting with
      the problem and people.__\n\nFocus on the problem first, invite fewer subject
      matter experts to the table and more the people that need the solution. Chelsey
      Lepage suggested framing the problem as a hunch to make everyone collaborating
      more comfortable when giving inputs. It was insightful to see design and product
      development concepts applied to program work in such a clear manner.\n\nIn agile
      product development, defining a good problem statement is always a challenge,
      and if it is not well-crafted, the user need (solution) will be unmet. Making
      sure the team and users are involved in the framing is the key. Otherwise, all
      those hours spent on meetings, coding and design will have resulted in something
      —  in this context, an initiative — that will never be used. \n\nDuring the
      webinar, other concepts drew on that shared parallel such as “success criteria''.
      Knowing what criteria must be met so it is considered a success and how you
      will measure and identify it is also a core part of the product development
      cycle. They are embedded in the user stories, so every feature built brings
      value and is solving a user need. In program design this was presented in the
      same way: how will you know that an objective in your program was met? What
      will success look like? The Reboot’s webinar made clear that such as it is in
      product development, a fruitful initiative design is impossible without true
      collaboration.\n\n— *Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America*\n\n__When
      developing a collaboration, work on building relationships before focusing on
      the technical challenges you hope to address together.__\n\nWhen launching or
      developing a collaboration, the webinar leads emphasized the importance of thinking
      about collaborations as ongoing journeys, with interpersonal relationships to
      develop and strengthen before technical challenges become the focus. Presenters
      emphasized that this happens with multiple touchpoints to strengthen the collaboration,
      to build social cohesion, and to have “conversations as humans first, and as
      representatives of an organization second”. As organizations work to develop
      strong and long-term collaborations, the webinar emphasized that relationship
      building early on can help strengthen the interpersonal accountability that
      can help with achieving success as a team. \n\nOver the last decade, Meedan
      has prioritized the development of a global community of contributors and collaborators,
      working together to build impactful projects at the intersection of information
      equity and accessibility, global journalism and digital literacy. This webinar
      emphasized an important value that we as an organization hold dear: as we continue
      to develop collaborations to address the pressing global challenges of today,
      we’re committed to centralizing the focus on all forms of expertise, ensuring
      that all stakeholders are part of collaboration design, and strengthening the
      foundational relationships that enable success and maximize the impact we can
      realize together. \n\n— *Nat Gyenes, Senior Program Manager and Lead, Digital
      Health Lab*\n\n__Living Expertise is a valuable form of expertise that’s often
      overlooked in favor of formal training and education.__\n\nThe webinar discussed
      the concept of Living Experts, defined as those who “understand the lived experience
      of a problem or context.” These experts sit alongside a diversity of perspectives
      in cross-sector collaboration, such as technical experts, decision makers, implementers
      and allies. “Take an expensive view of ‘expertise’,” noted the webinar leaders.
      At Check Global and in [Meedan programs](https://meedan.com/projects) overall,
      we aim to center different forms of expertise, and this framework made a lot
      of sense for how we try to implement our initiatives.\n\n— *Mina Xiao, Operations*"
