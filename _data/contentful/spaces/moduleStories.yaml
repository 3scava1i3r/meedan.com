    body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work
      remotely most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity
      for journalists, fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of
      COVID–19, the novel coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences
      focusing on Internet freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      the project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
      from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
      Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in
      COVID-19-related content, and  public health and science communication experts
      have been helping us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to
      ensure  accurate information can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate
      health information usually spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities
      at risk, but this year it’s more critical for us to accomplish what we usually
      do at conferences. While we are disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues
      in person, there’s an opportunity here. There have always been many reasons
      to have a virtual conference, but now there are more people and organizations
      motivated to do something about it - there are entire industries going virtual.
      At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity and inclusion amongst both staff
      and partners. If we work on this issue during a pandemic, we can make conferences
      more accessible for everyone as a long term goal too. Participants from emerging
      economies often have difficulty getting visas to attend conferences. Global
      climate change has led several people to forgo airplane travel. Parents have
      to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some disabilities make travel
      difficult, and the disability activism community has long called for improvements
      to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote participation has been used
      by several conferences to enable attendance for people who cannot travel. While
      this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual conferences are not widespread,
      and they lack virtual versions of useful conference activities. Many of the
      open source tools we use were designed by covering walls in a massive number
      of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What do you need from
      a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions? What works for
      you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe started with
      the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2. Presenting
      product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5. One-on-one
      discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7. Un-conference
      formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe came up
      with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked at
      were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
      budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
      high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
      indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
      thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
      has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a
      disability, however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is
      not an option at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling.
      As long as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate
      with other participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant
      lives in a region or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection.
      Any virtual conference technology has to take low bandwidth environments into
      account.\n\n3. This participant has a passport or legal status that makes it
      difficult for them to travel. They often get rejected for visas, even when they
      are a featured speaker at a conference. \n\n3. This participant lives in a country
      that censors the Internet and arrests journalists. In order to participate safely,
      they can only go to conferences with a no photo or video policy, whether this
      is a blanket ban or attendee preferences can be signaled by the color of their
      conference lanyard. Any virtual conference technology must allow private access,
      allowances for pseudonyms, participation without voice or video, and possibly
      compatibility with censorship circumvention technologies.\n\n4. This participant
      is Deaf. Their technology needs may include live captioning, participation by
      typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video of presenters to enable lip
      reading, or clear audio from participants depending on their level of hearing
      and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant is blind. Virtual
      conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers, and presenters
      should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of their presentation
      materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems understanding
      one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation, or
      just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
      participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the
      presentation. They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the
      ability to ask questions of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who
      need mobility aids face obstacles when traveling. Wheelchair users often get
      broken chairs back from airlines. When these chairs are custom fit, there are
      no temporary replacements that can make participating in a conference a pain-free
      experience. Power wheelchairs are very expensive, so travel can mean gambling
      with one’s mobility for a long time after a conference. \n\n9. This participant
      has modest tech skills and may need help with operating the interface for online
      meetings. Usability is an access issue. \n\nWe’re working with our communities
      to make lasting change out of this emergency situation. The civic tech community
      is evaluating software and practices for conferences and hackathons. We’re also
      expanding our online developer community. Let’s build something together! \n\nEmail
      us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a> to get started. "

      Conversations on family WhatsApp groups in India can be exhausting. *“Your bank has gone bust. Its share prices have dropped. Before you lose your life savings, find a reliable bank and transfer all your money.”* My anxious family members shared this message on one of our many family WhatsApp groups.

      The language and style of the message looked dubious to me. A few inquiries and one good fact-check relieved me: My bank was safe! Before I could share the good news on the family group, there was another forward that family members did not want anyone to miss. A big chocolate brand was gifting free chocolate hampers for Diwali! Before I could alert family members to not fall for the new hoax, there was mayhem on the group. The number of chocolate boxes purportedly being gifted increased with each message! So my little alert was buried in an avalanche of chocolate discussion among very excited young and old members of my family.

      Studies have shown that trust in the person sharing a message on closed messaging apps like WhatsApp is a key indicator of the message being shared multiple times. It is because of this trust that even suspicious looking messages are spread. I often talk with friends about this; *“What is the right strategy to call out family members sending fake news on WhatsApp groups?” “I can’t stop being Judge Judy on my family WhatsApp groups and people hate me for that.” “The last time I told my uncle his message was fake, he made a nasty comment and ignored me at the next family gathering.”*

      From first-hand experience running newsrooms, I can tell you that fact-checkers in India face similar concerns to my friends and I. I once met a media marketing manager who managed 60 WhatsApp groups. I wondered how he kept track of important messages. Shortly after that interaction, my newsroom went from print to digital, and I found myself on at least 40 WhatsApp groups that had media persons and other local professionals. The barrage of good morning messages did not stop until early evening. Group members were happy to share all kinds of unsolicited advice about personal or professional issues. Birthdays and anniversaries are big in India, and wishes, memes, songs on these occasions started from midnight and never ended! Amidst all this, fake information filtered into these groups as well. It was nearly impossible to keep track of conversations and information.

      What is the solution to this? Will we just learn to live surrounded by a fog of noise and misinformation?

      *“There’s a lot of noise on WhatsApp. Ignoring it is not an option; this is the pulse of conversations around us today. Addressing it is a challenge because of the clutter.”* My conversations with fact-checkers in India indicate high levels of exhaustion just from monitoring incoming messages on WhatsApp. Many of them work with limited resources and small teams. Managing a helpline on WhatsApp is not easy; from employment related inquiries to requests for setting up appointments with celebrities — fact-checkers have dealt with it all. There’s also video calls from users at all hours, pornographic content, trolls, these are also concerns flagged by fact-checkers in India.

      So how do fact-checking initiatives cope with this? Well…

      - Some have had to discontinue their helplines
      - Others have to scroll through several messages to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones
      - Fact-checkers are also relying on other social media platforms to look for relevant information to address. “We can’t not address misinformation on WhatsApp”, the last fact-checker I met said.

      #### Check is here to help!

      Meedan’s digital tool, Check, has features that can provide solutions to messages on closed apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was introduced to Check last year when I learned about Verificado, a collaborative election reporting and fact-checking project in Mexico. In March this year I was actively using Check while working on Checkpoint, a research project around the 2019 Indian general election where Check integrated with the WhatsApp Business API.

      As a Check journalist, there are many tasks that the tool simplified

      - I didn’t have to look at a WhatsApp number everyday to find relevant election related messages
      - It was possible for me to collaborate with other team members, even those members who were not physically present in the same space, because we all had access to the same feed
      - Finding important messages buried in a heap of junk also became easier because of Check
      - Keeping track of work and looking at patterns of misinformation was another task where different features of Check came in handy.

      I saw the potential of Check to perform many more tasks to help fact-checkers, journalists, activists and researchers. As a team member leading Meedan’s work in the Asia Pacific region, I am now engaging with new partners and introducing Check to their workflows. I understand the concerns of journalists and fact-checkers well, and some of their concerns are now on the roadmap for Meedan’s team to improve Check and enhance its features. As a Meedan team member, I understand how Check can be positioned in the work of organizations and how its existing features can be applied effectively. It’s a dynamic relationship and it’s a good place to be in.

      Before I joined Meedan as a software engineer in late 2011, this amazing team had already noticed that new media was ending the scarcity in which mass media journalism functioned. This was having repercussions for both newsgathering and publishing—no longer were audiences solely reliant on foreign reporters to tell the story. This was particularly true of the reporting of the Middle East, where citizen media been used so powerfully in the midst of such colossal social and political change during the Arab Spring. And citizen media should be verified.

      That’s when Meedan started working on this problem — clearly a very difficult nut to crack. It all started with a participatory liveblog with leading Egyptian independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.

      ![The Early Days: Checkdesk 1.0](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1pyqrBpzaGsslnQzRhWQbq/99411e1d90054d975042df1d3243377a/1_vhGxiy0adssnlxAxPYO91Q.png)

      Less than one year after I joined Meedan, around October 2012, the software engineering team (myself included) started working on a second iteration of this platform for collaborative fact-checking, which at that point was called Checkdesk, which we launched in July 2013.

      Checkdesk was a verification desk for the digital newsroom, designed to help curate user-generated content during breaking news and to connect journalists to citizen sources on the ground. We developed it in cooperation with six leading media outlets in the MENA region: Al Masry Al Youm and Welad El Balad Media Services in Egypt, 7iber in Jordan, Nahar Ashabab and Social Media Exchange (SMEX) in Lebanon, Ma’an Network in Palestine, and Al-Ayyam in Syria.

      ![Checkdesk 2.0 in action by Bellingcat](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/5hGviBzBImRaJ9H6kj2QvJ/6f2de5304cc654ba0983ec1a96bab305/1_v1g4OUFLKHmvwSv_ChhYRQ.gif)

      From a technological perspective, Checkdesk was built as a monolithic web application using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), an open source platform for web content management. As a CMS, Drupal was among the most successful and seemed like a great fit for our needs, because it strikes a great balance between getting up and running in no time, and the ability to extend its functionality almost infinitely. It served us quite well between 2013 and early 2016 and during that time we had the opportunity to [make numerous contributions to its community](https://www.drupal.org/node/2343639) and attend some Drupal conferences to share all the expertise we gained with that work.

      As our applications grew, we started facing scalability challenges with Drupal. These challenges manifested in many ways, from code maintainability to lower performance, proliferation of defects and automated testing. It was time for us to rethink our software architecture. We had to implement more features, go mobile, support more languages, handle more content, serve more users and face new social events—mainly elections.

      We accepted a big challenge at that time, which was to completely rewrite Checkdesk, in six months, from scratch, with a completely new code base.

      Personally, I had some good pre-Meedan experience with the open source web application framework [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) since 2009. During my early days at Meedan I had the opportunity to implement a prototype in Ruby On Rails for social media translation, which was called Translatedesk. This prototype evolved into a micro services architecture made of several Ruby On Rails APIs which were at the core of our translation product, [Bridge](https://meedan.com/en/bridge/).

      So we decided to pursue a similar software stack approach as Bridge and re-implemented Checkdesk as a multi-service application: some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs written in Ruby On Rails, a web application using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and, as usual, everything was released [as an open source project](https://github.com/meedan/check). We also started a new culture for our software development process, which includes writing automated tests for everything seeking [100% code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa/code), [continuous testing](http://travis-ci.org/meedan), [code quality with maximum GPA at Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa) and containerization of our softwares.

      Not only the code was rewritten, but also the branding: Checkdesk was brought out from behind the ‘desk.’ The 3.0 version of our open source software was rebranded as, simply, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

      ![Checkdesk 3.0, a.k.a. Check](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1Dkor8b2zPH26RZptleGDl/da47acfd15d8a1a4ec964482baa491fb/1_pcz3ZoK-tD_C9gnM2CCpnw.png)

      Check provides a central workbench facilitating online verification newsroom collaboration, allowing participating journalists and editors a simple and powerful framework to work together to investigate and annotate links, media and claims. This new code base has been serving us well since then, and during that time we implemented many improvements, new features and performance enhancements in order to accommodate its increasing usage. Since we first released it in October 2016, it was used by OJA-winning election monitoring projects like [Electionland](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/checking-the-vote-how-check-was-used-during-electionland-4242dd875e4b) (United States, 2016), [CrossCheck](https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.org/france-fr/) (France, 2017) and [Verificado](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/verificado-2018-wins-major-collaboration-and-partnerships-award-e6812ecbbdf) (Mexico, 2018), in addition to similar projects in Asia, namely [Indonesia, Philippines and India](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/meedan-in-asia-how-check-supported-three-simultaneous-election-reporting-initiatives-9b6626e89e3a).

      In India we had a new big challenge to face: misinformation on WhatsApp. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/). In December 2018 we started to integrate Check into the WhatsApp business API and released this feature in early April 2019, just in time for the elections in India. Check Message was born: our tool for fact-checking against disinformation at scale, seeking scalability, reliability and great performance.

      ![Check Message architecture](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4YDeFFaKebhPeh3N1xAt9p/f3f144a5e8ebbd10c083377b3db57b89/1_QEFoJ2yG5LvjfQVew-oPyA.png)

      Our collaboration in India, called [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched in April as the first real use case of Check Message. In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification and our software was useful to group duplicate requests, allow similar items to be related, prioritize most requested items and, in general, optimize the fact-checker’s work as much as possible.

      ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

      After this first release, we generalized our software module from WhatsApp-specific to more platform-agnostic, and we now support other closed message platforms, like Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. This module was implemented as a Check bot. Check allows for extensible scripts and functions that help you augment your verification experience with tools like private messenger integration, archiving and language detection. We call these scripts [bots](https://github.com/meedan/check-bots), and they live in the [Bot Garden](https://medium.com/meedan-user-guides/bot-garden-user-guide-adc2c1d743f3). We hope that this bot infrastructure can be used by other developers around the world to integrate Check with other tools and with their own workflows.

      We keep working on Check in order to improve user experience, content ingestion and augmented verification. Stay tuned! What I can say is that I’m really enjoying the things we are working on right now and really excited for the next challenges we’ll face and the new software support we’ll implement in the upcoming years in order to make Check even more global. I invite everyone to join us on that. If you are a software developer interested in open source and in these challenges we’re tackling, get in touch on [GitHub](http://github.com/meedan). If you are journalist and want to use Check for your project, get in touch with us on our [website](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

      Ultimately, it’s a collaborative effort.

    body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
      of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
      is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a
      global challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training
      sessions, host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and
      have network partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people,
      crossing borders, gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly
      global collaboration to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a
      global anti(in-person)-gathering. In Meedan terms: the future of our global
      town squares is dependent on our near term efforts to keep our physical town
      squares empty, and our digital town squares free of dangerous misinformation.
      \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic we are addressing the
      immediate needs of a global team and also working to develop programs that contribute
      to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing the lead of some other [inspiring
      organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
      \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and
      personal paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose
      school has been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members.
      We have closed our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have
      put a hold on the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.
      \  \n\nLast week we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support
      for their health and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans,
      budgets, and project timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent
      and encouragement of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development
      Cooperation Agency.  \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses.
      Last year we launched the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to
      health information as a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and
      Nat Gyenes framed some of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient
      piece in the Atlantic, [How Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
      \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous
      international bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable
      areas for civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with
      epidemiologists, public health communications experts, technology companies,
      and civil society partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository
      of annotated misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of
      our Check Global, Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies
      into this new program area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible
      threat to our emotional and physical well-being, I want to close this brief
      statement by saying perhaps this global project to stay apart might actually
      serve to bring together a world that is riven politically and ideologically.
      It’s going to take some brilliant and heroic collaborations to make it through
      the next several months and we are committed to doing what we can as an organization
      placed at the epicenter of misinformation response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist?

    body: "Misinfodemics, a term coined in 2018 by Meedan researchers, is a phenomenon
      in which online health misinformation contributes to the spread of real world
      disease. \n\nThe Lab’s [new report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf) notes
      that at both individual and population levels, low-quality online content about
      health topics can influence vaccination rates and herd immunity, the appropriate
      use of antibiotics and treatment regimens, the adoption of response efforts
      in epidemics, and access to care for serious illnesses. \n\nThe impact that
      this is having on population health suggests it is critical and urgent to re-think
      and innovate around the way we approach health misinformation.\n\n[Read the
