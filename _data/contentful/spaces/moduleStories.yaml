    body: "Today at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/), the largest
      worldwide gathering of fact-checkers, global technology not-for-profit Meedan
      announced a case study of a global fact-checking project using the [WhatsApp
      Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api). The groundbreaking study
      is based on nearly 5,700 fact-checks across India, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya
      and Nigeria and was made possible with support from WhatsApp and Facebook. \n\n<p
      class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a class=\"button no-margin\" href=\"https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact\">Download
      the full report: End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nFor the project, Meedan
      developed several software features on [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check),
      a web application for journalists to verify and annotate online information
      for open-source investigations, that were customized specifically for global
      fact-checking organizations and deployed by the AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa
      Check, BOOM and India Today. They have  been running since October 2019 across
      4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions
      today. \n\nThe report, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact),
      details the insights, field research and product features made that maximized
      the value of the API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference
      to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on the end-to-end encrypted
      service.   \n\n“Fact-checkers working globally have a variety of needs, so we
      built tools that optimize workflows and the nuances of AI in order to create
      a roadmap for improving fact-checking and information integrity across the web,”
      said Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan. “This effort has been highly collaborative, and we
      appreciate the support and guidance that we were given from the teams at AFP,
      Africa Check, BOOM and India Today in particular.”\n\nThe report offers the
      following core insights:\n\n#### Bots are the new audience engagement paradigm.
      \nA WhatsApp fact-Checking bot can serve three purposes: (1) help audiences
      understand how to interact with the fact-checking team and see commonly-requested
      content, (2) serve as a bridge between a human editor and someone submitting
      content to a tipline and (3) cut down on unactionable content.\n\n#### Machines
      in the loop augment quality human efforts.\nAlready designed for human work,
      Check now automates everything from content matching to intake, helping fact-checkers
      do their jobs more efficiently and therefore effectively.\n\n#### Follow the
      news cycle.\nNewsrooms learned that a topic-oriented approach to tipline promotion
      following the news cycle yields stronger audience engagement and submissions.
      After the outbreak of COVID-19, we saw an uptick in the percentage of quality,
      actionable content, in turn generating better fact-checks.\n\n#### Fact-checkers
      need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces in multiple languages.\nWe adapted our
      toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on the fact-checking rather rather than
      technical tasks. This enabled teams to customize their workflows.\n\n“We used
      to get inundated by the thousands of messages that people would send us on WhatsApp,”
      said Balkrishna, fact-checking editor at [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/).
      “Check has not only made it possible for us to sift through the fact-check requests
      quickly, it also helped deliver most of our readers with fast and personalized
      responses. This helps us build a direct bond of trust with our audience.” \n\n“Check
      really improved the way we communicate with our readers on WhatsApp,” said María
      Clara Pestre, a fact-checker at [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/) (Brazil).
      “Now, we can be sure anyone who reaches out through the app will have an immediate
      and consistent reply, while having time to dedicate ourselves to other parts
      of the verification process.”\n\n“We’re excited to work with partners like Meedan
      to help address the challenge of misinformation within private messaging. Our
      approach is to give users tools to easily get accurate information and support
      fact checking,” said Ben Supple, head of civic engagement at WhatsApp. “We appreciate
      and value the work done to maximize the WhatsApp Business API for fact checkers
      and ensure more people have access to accurate information at the click of a
      button.”\n\nMeedan presented this study at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
      with representatives from WhatsApp, the International Fact Checking Network,
      Boom and Africa Check. See the video from the panel here:\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe

      Shalini Joshi moderates a discussion about the evolution of fact-checking on
      WhatsApp at Global Fact 7</p>\n\nTo support this work, Meedan developed a number
      of key software features that maximized the WhatsApp Business API with a mix
      of AI, interface and multilingual innovations, including:\n\n__Multilingual
      WhatsApp Bot:__ a customizable bot that presents both intuitive menu items and
      human conversations with fact-checkers in multiple languages\n\n__Workflow Automation:__
      a triage system to recognize, review and prioritize claims and responses\n\n__Similarity
      Analysis:__ algorithms that detect content patterns and trends based on variations
      of the same claims\n\n__Response at Scale:__ a publishing system to send fact-check
      reports to tipline users who send duplicate or similar requests\n\n“Our goal
      with [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check),” explained Meedan’s Director of Product
      Pierre Conti, “is to build a scalable human and AI system for fact-checkers
      to efficiently size the demand for verification directly from their audience,
      cut through the noise, and maximize impact by helping them to prioritize their
      response to the most pressing misinformation.”"

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Today the health communications organization [Nigeria Health Watch](https://nigeriahealthwatch.com/)
      and Meedan announce a partnership to counter misinformation around COVID-19
      and other public health challenges in Nigeria. This partnership will take place
      through Meedan's [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/).
      \n\nThe spread of misinformation during disease outbreaks is a global issue.
      False or misleading information around disease prevention, treatment and cures
      can can cause confusion and panic, and can be dangerous to public health. There
      is there an urgent need for collaboration to address widespread health misinformation
      as governments tackle the double epidemic of misinformation and COVID-19.\n\nThrough
      the partnership, potentially false or misleading COVID-19 claims will be identified,
      and Nigeria Health Watch will leverage Meedan’s [team of experts](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/about/)
      to produce multimedia messages that debunk misinformation around the virus.
      The multimedia messages will include critical context and background information
      that is key to safely communicating debunks to misinformation. The project will
      apply insights from collated data to create evidence-based media campaigns to
      counter COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nManaging Director at Nigeria Health Watch,
      Vivianne Ihekweazu, said “Misinformation poses a threat to the public response
      to outbreaks, eroding the public’s trust, and their willingness and ability
      to take preventative measures.\" \n\n“As we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. Strained access
      to health experts during emergencies, such as the one we’re experiencing, can
      quickly lead to poor health outcomes, as low-quality information exacerbates
      the real-world spread of disease,” said Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab
      lead. \n\n#### About Nigeria Health Watch\nNigeria Health Watch uses informed
      advocacy and communication to influence health policy and seek better health
      and access to healthcare in Nigeria. We seek to amplify some of the great work
      happening in the health sector, challenge the bad, and create a space for positive
      ideas and action. Through its various platforms, Nigeria Health Watch is a trusted
      source that provides informed commentary and in-depth analysis of health issues
      in Nigeria, always in good conscience. \n\n#### About Meedan\nMeedan is a technology

      the report</a>\n</p>\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the [2020 Global Misinfodemic
      Report](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/),
      a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information scholars, legal
      experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining the impacts of
      COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Brazil
      and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts and journalists
      from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and fact-checking organizations,
      the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation into the way this unprecedented
      viral event is both reforming and confirming the state of our global information
      ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, as countries worked to contain the
      first signs of the physical virus spreading, a secondary crisis occured: misinformation
      on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
      [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
      and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
      \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
      UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
      and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health
      advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the
      airwaves. Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going
      viral, stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against
      this disease, too.”\n\nA misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers
      in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
      and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
      leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
      interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
      approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report
      touches on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are
      spreading online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating
      with certain communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation
      on  public health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging
      economies?\n- What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe
      first wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed
      world, but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New
      York Times editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies
      ahead is the spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict,
      through packed refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh,
      through teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social
      distancing is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without
      the fiscal capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would
      be disastrous not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies
      of raw materials are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger
      and the virus doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely
      to ensue, long after countries in North America and Europe control their initial
      outbreaks, is sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about
      the pandemic. In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our
      partners’ fact-checking tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched
      COVID-19 misinformation evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments
      involving tea, vitamins, hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation
      about penalties for spreading misinformation or just spreading information,
      about the pandemic \n- Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this
      misinformation can trigger real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing
