    body: "### The 2020 Global Misinfodemic Report examines the impact of COVID-19
      outside of the Global North\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the 2020 Global
      Misinfodemic Report, a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information
      scholars, legal experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining
      the impacts of COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong
      Kong, Brazil and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts
      and journalists from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and
      fact-checking organizations, the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation
      into the way this unprecedented viral event is both reforming and confirming
      the state of our global information ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020,
      as countries worked to contain the first signs of the physical virus spreading,
      a secondary crisis occured: misinformation on platforms like Twitter, Facebook
      and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
      [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
      and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
      \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
      UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
      and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health
      advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the
      airwaves. Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going
      viral, stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against
      this disease, too.”\n\nA misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers
      in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
      and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
      leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
      interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
      approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report
      touches on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are
      spreading online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating
      with certain communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation
      on  public health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging
      economies?\n- What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe
      first wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed
      world, but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New
      York Times editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies
      ahead is the spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict,
      through packed refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh,
      through teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social
      distancing is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without
      the fiscal capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would
      be disastrous not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies
      of raw materials are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger
      and the virus doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely
      to ensue, long after countries in North America and Europe control their initial
      outbreaks, is sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about
      the pandemic. In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our
      partners’ fact-checking tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched
      COVID-19 misinformation evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments
      involving tea, vitamins, hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation
      about penalties for spreading misinformation or just spreading information,
      about the pandemic \n- Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this
      misinformation can trigger real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing
      the most obvious and harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where
      [people are dying from drinking Methanol after false and misleading information
      circulated on social media about its use as a treatment](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/nearly-500-people-dead-in-iran-after-drinking-methanol-to-fight-off-covid-19-1.4870674).
      In other regions, the misinfodemic materializes as public trust in leadership
      weans and citizens look to sometimes misguided informal leaders for answers
      to complex scientific information. \n\nAs both the physical and online virus
      rages on into the summer, the Global Misinfodemic Report will begin publishing
      groups of articles from contributors around the world. Look back here or [sign
      up for our newsletter](https://meedan.com/contact) for updates on when to expect
      the first batch of articles. "

      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus. This is particularly challenging for civil society
      organisations and grassroots collectives who are still struggling to make sense
      of, and to counter the effects of, the outbreak on their own local contexts.
      \n\nIn an attempt to support independent media, fact-checkers, citizen journalists,
      activists, and technology and digital literacy enthusiasts in their efforts
      to cover the outbreak, Meedan's Check Global program is launching the COVID-19
      Microgrants, specifically aimed at groups working within the context of emerging
      economies (North Africa/West Asia, Africa, Latin America, Asia-Pacific region).
      \n\nThe grants are aimed at supporting fact-checking and verification projects,
      local watchdog initiatives, documentation of the local reality under quarantine,
      media/digital literacy campaigns, [tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/04/06/how-will-coronavirus-reshape-democracy-and-governance-globally-pub-81470),

    body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
      massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
      support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
      researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
      a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
      and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
      infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material
      for journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize
      pandemic-related information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can
      present a bottleneck for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies,
      when demand for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the
      Harvard School of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have
      been researching how health information inequity and digital health misinformation
      can impact the spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps
      that can exacerbate those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care.
      \n\nIt is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic,
      that two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
      and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
      health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research
      and epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious
      disease researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively
      to a wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
      is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
      CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
      and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
      — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the
      second challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is
      supplying important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan
      to utilize ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate
      can be shared readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database
      into fact-checking bot workflows that many of our partners are already using
      to source questions from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to
      either access existing resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries
      to be fact-checked. This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations
      directly, and providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable
      initiatives being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health
      ministries around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality
      information through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative,
      Twitter, Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency
      and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered
      around six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access
      to experts can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities
      to access reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is
      populated and regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly
      sourced questions and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental
      health organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs
      during the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global
      network of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain
      the database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers
      and communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
      COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
      public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
      required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue
      to collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies
      and evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact
      assessment, monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design.
      In addition to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate
      to be working with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City
      University, as well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the
      behavioral impact of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database
      priorities and content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist
      COVID-19 response effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative
      \ to bridge research and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators.
      We are developing templates for packaged, verified content that can be included
      in outputs sent from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded
      in behavior science and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of
      care for communications, and include best practices for addressing health information
      response challenges, such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and
      transparency in the ever-changing information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__
      We are prioritizing pathways for disseminating contents of the database across
      languages to fact-checkers and pandemic communicators around the world. We are
      also integrating into Meedan’s open source verification and fact-checking workspace
      software, Check, in order to make its expert-reviewed contents available to
      the public. Through Check, we are creating an interface for users to design
      custom multilingual bots for disseminating their fact-checked content, connecting
      users to closed messaging networks including Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct
      Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then be able to access a subset of relevant
      resources, selected by each fact-checking organization individually, via a simple
      query system, and will be presented with short lists of up-to-date content that
      matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__ Through this project, we are examining
      the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions across languages and geographies,
      exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation, and translating findings
      into useful insights for public health communicators. In addition, as a group
      that works closely with partners in emerging economies, Meedan is closely following
      the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people living in densely populated
      urban areas and underserved communities that don't have access to public health
      care systems. Our team members in different regions are tracking the impact
      of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence against women, and insights
      will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. During this historic
      time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical questions about
      everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious disease research.
      Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer questions about
      complex health information, medical research and epidemiological findings, while
      public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers struggle to urgently
      communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The result of this problem
      set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor health outcomes,
      as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world spread of
      disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure on fact-checking
      organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience to health
      experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including research
      on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and the
      Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
      Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped
      much of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of
      Meedan’s Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal
      of promoting health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six
      years, these ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night
      dinners and graduate school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu
      brainstorming, in sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival,
      the Digital Health @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News
      Initiative Summits, in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics,
      mixed methods, and human rights lectures, and in conversations between friends
      and colleagues, hopeful in our ability to create something important together.
      I am immensely grateful to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make
      the most of our work together, and to all of our supporters as we further develop
      this intersection.\n\nThis COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without
      the partnership and collaboration of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural
      Insights Team, Birmingham City University, students and researchers from the
      Harvard School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
      and our network of public health specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this
      initiative, we are keen to learn and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity
      to contribute to the challenging and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators
      are doing to address this pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please
      reach out at health@meedan.com to talk more.\n"

    body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives
      is one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
      with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
      and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
      expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
      information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
      health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
      fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and
      time at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This
      ensures that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time.
      Including specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization
      hosts daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries
      may change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the
      exact point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2.
      Be context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
      For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
      about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
      to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only.
      This ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
      and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular
      treatments have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information
      you use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information
      you have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed
      to publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
      such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
      This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
      information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
      with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
      a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
      to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
      our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
      health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
      is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
      and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
      a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
      for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
      Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical
      recommendations to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with
      that. If there are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants
      answered, they can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:
      \ \n\n>   “If you're looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare
      provider, and   be sure to review the World Health Organization website for
      more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs
      the COVID-19 pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents
      and screens, drastically impacting public health, our way of life and global
      markets, Meedan is also reflecting on this historic moment and its emerging
      lessons: In the coming weeks we will be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19,
      written by journalists, fact-checkers, censorship experts, thought leaders and
      academics. The contributors are writing about the pandemic through the fog of
      the war— filing reports and analyses as news is still breaking, long before
      we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe analyses will aim to shine a
      light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship, localization of information
      access, and public trust, as we start to think about moving forward and away
      from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this in our newsletter and
      on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
      The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should
      not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized
      for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection
      is possible\"\n\n"

    body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
      of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
      ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
      to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso,
      and Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with
      newsrooms, fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three
      continents.\n\nThis represents significant growth from previous years, allowing
      us to deepen our support for these regions with program leads who are deeply
      familiar with their local contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our
      amazing partners around the world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional
      leads, along with Wafaa Heikal, our long-running program manager who is now
      heading up our efforts in Africa and the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini
      Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi is passionate about feminism and local journalism.
      Over the last two decades, her work has brought the two together. Shalini has
      studied misinformation, particularly on closed messaging platforms. She has
      been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/)
      ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)). The fellowship focused on designing creative
      ways to counter misinformation. As a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/),
      ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/)
      - a research project focused on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini
      started her professional journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/),
      a centre for gender education. She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented
      communities to come into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes.
      Shalini is the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/)
      (“News Waves” in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya
      is known for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women
      from some of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project
      is a testament to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent
      media is essential, as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini
      believes that [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can
      be a turning point for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation
      shared on closed messaging platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate,
      annotate, verify and archive misinformation and Shalini believes that for several
      small and independent newsrooms, this is a great service that no other platform
      currently provides. Check has tremendous potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers
      to design collaborative projects, especially around areas of common interest.
      Its unique features are great for large projects on politics, health, climate
      change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n### Meet Isabella Barroso
      in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa, is Meedan's Latin
      America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms in both Spanish
      and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's program team
      with a passion for human-centred design and product development that is fit
      to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design, Isa
      hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills in
      product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
      journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
      [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
      and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am
      now developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\"
      noted Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned
      a lot about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this
      happens with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America
      seems to be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging
      on closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
      overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
      Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in
      journalism. She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy
      to literature. \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with
      culture and social media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first
      job was as a culture journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
      due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
      came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
      of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
      I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
      open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
      the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
      media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
      with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news
      cycle. In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor
      and verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human
      rights researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
      annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
      open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support
      different workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate
      and what context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work
      across an interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with
      small teams and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring
      projects, understanding the particular national context and partner capacities
      and then designing new workflows around them.”\n\n"
