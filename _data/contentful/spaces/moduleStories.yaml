      Free flow of reliable and independent information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However, with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people have limited access to independent information, and few spaces to dialogue and discuss the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain the pandemic. This challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly complex and evolving information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers are expected to distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious disease.

      People need news and information they can trust. Instead of making this available, governments are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information and scrutinizing voices that seek accountability.

      In order to analyze and discuss potential solutions to the current misinfodemic, Meedan hosted an online event on June 18, 2020 entitled, ‘Reporting Barriers During COVID-19. The session had veteran journalist and co-founder of Rappler, [Maria Ressa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Ressa) in conversation with [Dima Saber](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/-centres-of-excellence/centre-for-media-and-culture-studies/our-people/dima-saber), Meedan's Director of Check Global Program and Impact.

    body: "As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, media narratives have focused
      first on how this has affected the global north, even while [experts flagged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html
      \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot
      of people.’\") that the worst was yet to come. In the past few months, the pandemic
      has hit emerging economies with dense urban populations in which social distancing
      and isolation are impossibilities. \n\nLatin America's societies have seen the
      horror of [bodies piling](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bodies-piled-ecuador-covid-19-hotspot-200617142117507.html
      \"When bodies piled up: Inside Ecuador's first coronavirus hotspot\") on the
      streets of Ecuador, among the dead those of at least [9 journalists](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/los-riesgos-de-cubrir-la-pandemia-en-ecuador-fad831054013
      \"Los riesgos de cubrir la pandemia en Ecuador\") that died because of lack
      of protection equipment during work. At the same time, Brazil now has the [second
      highest ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html \"COVID-19 Johns Hopkins Dashboard\")
      death toll in the world, and the favelas population are left to their own luck
      while [self-organizing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html
      \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot
      of people.’\") to fight against the virus. \n\nThe pandemic arrives in a context
      that according to the [2019 Reporters Without Borders Index](https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-freedom-index-cycle-fear
      \"2019 World Press Freedom Index – A cycle of fear \"), has seen in the last
      years a surge in corruption, increasingly concentrated media ownership and violence
      against journalists. This has contributed to a spike in fear and self-censorship,
      state censorship and authoritarian excesses, disinformation and cyber-harassment.\n\nMedia
      concentration turned historically family-owned companies into conglomerates.
      [UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421 \"Unesco\") has
      warned about the threats of this process: when combined with property concentration,
      geographic concentration also affects pluralism and diversity, as it generates
      a uniformity of agendas and informational contents. Concentration is perceived
      as ‘indirect censorship’ by international and supranational organisations such
      as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n\nA form of media ecosystem
      response to this oppressive scenario is the emerging number of independent media
      outlets. A great example is in the Northern Triangle where [independent media](https://niemanreports.org/articles/how-independent-journalists-in-latin-america-are-finding-new-ways-to-hold-power-to-account/
      \"How Independent Journalists in Latin America are Finding New Ways to Hold
      Power to Account\") has been on the rise as well as in most of Latin America.
      [Public interest](http://waccglobal.org/articles/a-new-wave-of-public-service-journalism-in-latin-america
      \"A new wave of public service journalism in Latin America\") journalism is
      trying to make governments accountable to their oppressions and mistakes. \n\nIn
      2021 we aim to expand our support to new partners initiatives in these regions
      of Latin America, such as the Northern Triangle (Honduras, Salvador and Guatemala)
      that in the last decade have seen violence escalate since a wave of street gang
      members  deported from [prisons in the USA](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/12/08/the-northern-triangle-is-becoming-less-murderous
      \"The Northern Triangle is becoming less murderous\") arrived in El Salvador.
      This and years of unrest has [started waves of migration ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/central-americas-turbulent-northern-triangle
      \"Central America’s Turbulent Northern Triangle\") that have resulted in millions
      of people seeking better living conditions. For an example, see the work of
      Chicas Poderosas on [migration stories in Latin America](https://10-historias-migrantes.webflow.io/)
      covering minorities published in 2019 with Check Global support.\n\nOur work
      with the [Check Global  project](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
      is to address inequities in access to information, increase media literacy skills
      and counter misinformation, but how does this look during a global pandemic
      and economic crisis?  Much of it involves supporting our partners in adapting
      their strategies and plans to better respond to their communities’ needs during
      this time. Here’s what we’ve been doing, and what’s coming next:\n\n![Chicas
      Poderosas: An agile response to COVID-19](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6L6xpRBHVpgIDLFUzWjQH4/1fa06b3c0215c861fa835c752dd58ded/EYtMtTTXYAEkO0X)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Chicas Poderosas's new MOOC focused on women and leadership
      skills. Image from Chicas Poderosas.</p>\n\n### Chicas Poderosas: An agile response
      to COVID-19 \n\n[Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/) has adapted
      with agility to this new challenge. A global, 18-country community that promotes
      change by inspiring and fostering the development of women in the media, they
      migrated their flagship event to an online format, creating their first Online
      Mediathon in Ecuador that is scheduled to happen at the end of 2020 , in which
      100 women will be trained in journalism and media skills. \n\nThey have also
      launched  [\"Women, Power and the Media\"](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/JC/mujerpoderymedios.html)
      a MOOC with attendees numbering as high as 3,900 women and increasing everyday,
      with support from Check Global and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/)
      and hosted by the [Knight Center](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/). The online
      course has been designed for women who work in the media and journalism field
      so they can strengthen their current leadership tools, acquire new ones and
      learn from the professional practices of other women leaders. The community
      that is organically being formed around it created job boards to share opportunities,
      study groups for LGBTQIA+ members in Guatemala and journalists that work with
      gender issues. This course will be translated to arabic and localized to the
      [NAWA Media](https://nawamedia.org/) website an open-access platform aimed at
      media professionals and journalism students in North Africa and Western Asia
      (NAWA) offering them support through training resources. \n \nAnother response
      to the pandemic was [Conversaciones Poderosas: COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHhWDKq8tA7U9BMlCkHA7uLSCo0gCMEga)
      (Powerful Conversations) a series of 8 facilitated conversations between media
      professionals published on the Chicas Poderosas YouTube channel, an initiative
      aimed to support Spanish-speaking journalists covering COVID–19.\n\nUnderstanding
      that women in Latin America have long been denied agency in healthcare and that
      this new virus is one of several health concerns, the project _Hermanas [Sisters]:
      Information to accelerate women's health_ was created to transform medical information
      and studies into accessible, attractive, and high-impact content, providing
      clear, verified information that will normalize prevention behaviors and question
      stereotypes. This will be shared under a Creative Commons license so it can
      be localized, translated and applied to other contexts.\n\n![Animal Politico:

      class=\"caption\">Animal Politico's website showing their work with new formats
      of multimedia content focused on misinformation.</p>\n\n### Animal Politico:
      Supporting journalism innovation during a pandemic\n\nThe elections in Mexico,
      Brazil, Venezuela, Paraguay, Colombia and El Salvador prompted an increase in
      attacks on journalists, especially by politicians, government officials and
      cyber-activists, and reinforced a climate of mistrust and animosity towards
      the media. Journalists are frequent [targets of death threats](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-19955-wave-threats-journalists-colombia-scares-and-awakens-memory-years-violence-against-pre),
      physical violence, and abduction.\n\n[Animal Politico](https://www.animalpolitico.com/),
      our Check Global partner based in Mexico, suffered cyber attacks in 2019 as
      a result of the independent work they do in what [Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/countries-cracked-down-on-asylum-and-the-right-to-protest-in-the-americas-in-2019/)
      has called one of the world’s deadliest countries to journalists. This year
      we are supporting them to continue their fact-checking work and research in
      social media to understand how disinformation that appears to be inoffensive
      is often focused on promoting hate speech and gender issues. They in turn are
      creating media literacy content in multimedia formats to access new and young
      audiences.\n\n![COVID-19 Micro-grants: Support for women-led grassroots organizations](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4fpXTP7P2u94ySEuHTfMMX/06cf703ae12797dbbecfe0100d7bfb56/Ruda29_1_.jpg)\n<p

      COVID-19 Micro-grants: Support for women-led grassroots organizations\n\nBeyond
      our existing partners, Check Global has been keen to support a broader range
      of organizations. This year, we launched [25 micro-grants](https://meedan.com/blog/25-grassroots-projects-awarded-through-the-check-global-covid-19-fund/)
      to support independent grassroots organisations. Amongst them, we supported
      7 organizations in Latin America. One such group is [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/)(Collective
      Cirandeiras), who will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders
      in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be
      supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets
      in Cuba [Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) (Journalism
      of the Barrio) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/) (The Touch) to increase regional
      awareness in matters related to the pandemic. \n\nAnother fact-checking initiative
      [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/)(Eté Fact-Checking) works and specializes
      in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population
      in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com)(Ruda Collective) a group
      of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the
      impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With
      the theme “From my window” [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/)
      (Mulherias Collective) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in
      the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador
      we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)
      develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community
      in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in
      El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.gdezza.net)
      and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.\n             \nMeedan
      has experience running projects of [open-source investigations](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/27/help_bellingca_and_tbij_investigate_airstrikes/),
      collaborative journalism and [innovation](https://meedan.com/blog/how-meedan-supported-three-reporting-initiatives-in-asia/).
      Bringing this knowledge to grassroot organizations and adding them to the Check
      Global network brings possibilities of collaboration and building better products
      by having these organizations use our [open source software Check](https://meedan.com/check)
      in new ways, while tapping into the broader Check Global network initiatives,
      such as our network training calls and webinars, and potentially accessing expert-sourced
      information from our [COVID-19 Expert Database.](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)\n\n###
      Datos desaparecidos: memory as resistance \n\nThe rise of [conservative](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/16/the-trumpification-of-the-latin-american-right/),
      oppressive and misogynist governments in the region has led to a [spike in feminist
      activism](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/oppressive-sexist-policies-galvanize-bold-fight-for-womens-rights-in-2018/)
      and women jornalists uniting in [public manifestations](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21674-latin-american-women-journalists-march-equal-rights-and-against-gender-violence)
      in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, México, Chile and Brazil to advocate
      for human rights. These democratic activities led by activists, protesters and
      civil societies have been brutally shut down by governments. According to Amnesty
      International, these actions have resulted in the [death of 210](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/)
      people involved in protests. \n\nIn this digital age, memory is now born digitally,
      disseminated by activists and underrepresented communities in private platforms
      such as Facebook and Instagram. In 1973, the government of Argentina began disappearing
      people as a form of oppression, a practice that continues today in a number
      of Latin American countries under the frightful neologism of *desaparecidos*,
      or “the disappeared.” Today, we also struggle with *datos desaparecidos*, or
      disappeared data. Memory is a living thing and as a social practice it changes
      in each interaction, each time it is recalled. By preserving digital activism
      media and freedom of expression is a way to preserve integrity of these narratives.
      \ It is important to safekeep these digital archives and memories from private
      company servers and interests. Open source technology can serve as an alternative.
      \n\nOur work in this discussion is facilitating and organizing community initiatives
      to address this issue, during events such as RightsCon 2020 and [Internet Freedom
      Glitter Meetup](https://meedan.com/events/internet-freedom-festival-glitter-meetup-recordkeepers-of-the-resistance/).
      We hope to open and share knowledge with intersectional feminist and freedom
      of expression communities and worldwide on how to safekeep historical records
      as the world fights a pandemic. We invite you to attend these events in our
      efforts to develop memory as a form of resistance.\n\nYou can read a bit more
      on [how memory has been erased during COVID-19 in Brazil](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-in-brazil-memory-as-a-form-of-resistance/)
      and the role that open source technology can have on safekeeping it.\n\n###
      Media Literacy: supporting media education to fight the misinfodemic \n\nThe
      region is seeing [a rise](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml)
      in scientific and history [negationism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/03/denialism-what-drives-people-to-reject-the-truth)
      propagated by these governments, resulting in actions that will affect millions
      of people in the following years, focused on weakening the education system
      by diminishing the research budget in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/students-protest-across-brazil-over-jair-bolsonaros-sweeping-cuts-to-education)
      and [Argentina](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/thousands-scientists-argentina-strike-protest-budget-cuts),
      while in [Chile](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47525165) the system is failing
      the population. There has been an increase in [media education](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-20805-independent-media-northern-triangle-are-strengthened-do-data-journalism-limited-resour)
      and training initiatives as a response to the [misinformation](https://aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-foi-o-mais-citado-em-desinformacao-checada-no-facebook-em-2019/)
      platform that these governments have chosen to run. Media literacy in Brazil
      is now a [subject](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/educacao/noticia/2019-02/educacao-midiatica-forma-cidadao-consciente-dizem-especialistas)
      that will be added to the mandatory curriculum of schools.\n\nEducation is a
      strategy to [fight misinformation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421)
      and prevent future societal situations as the one we are living by training
      future journalists and university students in understanding media work. We can
      train teachers on how to do this inside Check and using our resources. It can
      be used to expand product applicability by creating workflows inside Check designed
      specifically for this purpose. This would be a key asset for future partnerships
      with universities, communities and educational institutes. If you are interested
      in this opportunity, please get in touch. We have the Check U programme, with
      a 10-module curriculum designed specifically for health misinformation that
      can be implemented by schools, and we are keen to partner with a local educator
      to ensure these resources are translated and localized to Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n###
      What's next for Check Global\n\nThe situation in Latin America continues to
      present numerous challenges that COVID-19 exacerbates and that will have lasting
      effects long after the pandemic is over. Our work at Meedan is to continue the
      support of our partners' impact during this time and to expand the access to
      information in the region. To achieve this, we will build on shared knowledge
      from our Check Global network and communities in NAWA, Asia Pacific and Africa.
      They have unifying health and political aspects during this pandemic, share
      colonial contexts, face similar issues and are crafting their own solutions
      as they lead the pathway to a more equitable internet and future."

    body: "Today at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/), the largest
      worldwide gathering of fact-checkers, global technology not-for-profit Meedan
      announced a case study of a global fact-checking project using the [WhatsApp
      Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api). The groundbreaking study
      is based on nearly 5,700 fact-checks across India, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya
      and Nigeria and was made possible with support from WhatsApp and Facebook. \n\n<p

      the full report: End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nFor the project, Meedan
      developed several software features on [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check),
      a web application for journalists to verify and annotate online information
      for open-source investigations, that were customized specifically for global
      fact-checking organizations and deployed by the AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa
      Check, BOOM and India Today. They have  been running since October 2019 across
      4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions
      today. \n\nThe report, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact),
      details the insights, field research and product features made that maximized
      the value of the API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference
      to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on the end-to-end encrypted
      service.   \n\n“Fact-checkers working globally have a variety of needs, so we
      built tools that optimize workflows and the nuances of AI in order to create
      a roadmap for improving fact-checking and information integrity across the web,”
      said Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan. “This effort has been highly collaborative, and we
      appreciate the support and guidance that we were given from the teams at AFP,
      Africa Check, BOOM and India Today in particular.”\n\nThe report offers the
      following core insights:\n\n#### Bots are the new audience engagement paradigm.
      \nA WhatsApp fact-Checking bot can serve three purposes: (1) help audiences
      understand how to interact with the fact-checking team and see commonly-requested
      content, (2) serve as a bridge between a human editor and someone submitting
      content to a tipline and (3) cut down on unactionable content.\n\n#### Machines
      in the loop augment quality human efforts.\nAlready designed for human work,
      Check now automates everything from content matching to intake, helping fact-checkers
      do their jobs more efficiently and therefore effectively.\n\n#### Follow the
      news cycle.\nNewsrooms learned that a topic-oriented approach to tipline promotion
      following the news cycle yields stronger audience engagement and submissions.
      After the outbreak of COVID-19, we saw an uptick in the percentage of quality,
      actionable content, in turn generating better fact-checks.\n\n#### Fact-checkers
      need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces in multiple languages.\nWe adapted our
      toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on the fact-checking rather rather than
      technical tasks. This enabled teams to customize their workflows.\n\n“We used
      to get inundated by the thousands of messages that people would send us on WhatsApp,”
      said Balkrishna, fact-checking editor at [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/).
      “Check has not only made it possible for us to sift through the fact-check requests
      quickly, it also helped deliver most of our readers with fast and personalized
      responses. This helps us build a direct bond of trust with our audience.” \n\n“Check
      really improved the way we communicate with our readers on WhatsApp,” said María
      Clara Pestre, a fact-checker at [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/) (Brazil).
      “Now, we can be sure anyone who reaches out through the app will have an immediate
      and consistent reply, while having time to dedicate ourselves to other parts
      of the verification process.”\n\n“We’re excited to work with partners like Meedan
      to help address the challenge of misinformation within private messaging. Our
      approach is to give users tools to easily get accurate information and support
      fact checking,” said Ben Supple, head of civic engagement at WhatsApp. “We appreciate
      and value the work done to maximize the WhatsApp Business API for fact checkers
      and ensure more people have access to accurate information at the click of a
      button.”\n\nMeedan presented this study at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
      with representatives from WhatsApp, the International Fact Checking Network,
      Boom and Africa Check. See the video from the panel here:\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe

      Shalini Joshi moderates a discussion about the evolution of fact-checking on
      WhatsApp at Global Fact 7</p>\n\nTo support this work, Meedan developed a number
      of key software features that maximized the WhatsApp Business API with a mix
      of AI, interface and multilingual innovations, including:\n\n__Multilingual
      WhatsApp Bot:__ a customizable bot that presents both intuitive menu items and
      human conversations with fact-checkers in multiple languages\n\n__Workflow Automation:__
      a triage system to recognize, review and prioritize claims and responses\n\n__Similarity
      Analysis:__ algorithms that detect content patterns and trends based on variations
      of the same claims\n\n__Response at Scale:__ a publishing system to send fact-check
      reports to tipline users who send duplicate or similar requests\n\n“Our goal
      with [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check),” explained Meedan’s Director of Product
      Pierre Conti, “is to build a scalable human and AI system for fact-checkers
      to efficiently size the demand for verification directly from their audience,
      cut through the noise, and maximize impact by helping them to prioritize their
      response to the most pressing misinformation.”"

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!
