    body: "Today at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/), the largest
      worldwide gathering of fact-checkers, global technology not-for-profit Meedan
      announced a case study of a global fact-checking project using the [WhatsApp
      Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api). The groundbreaking study
      is based on nearly 5,700 fact-checks across India, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya
      and Nigeria and was made possible with support from WhatsApp and Facebook. \n\n<p
      class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a class=\"button no-margin\" href=\"https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact\">Download
      the full report: End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nFor the project, Meedan
      developed several software features on [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check),
      a web application for journalists to verify and annotate online information
      for open-source investigations, that were customized specifically for global
      fact-checking organizations and deployed by the AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa
      Check, BOOM and India Today. They have  been running since October 2019 across
      4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions
      today. \n\nThe report, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact),
      details the insights, field research and product features made that maximized
      the value of the API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference
      to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on the end-to-end encrypted
      service.   \n\n“Fact-checkers working globally have a variety of needs, so we
      built tools that optimize workflows and the nuances of AI in order to create
      a roadmap for improving fact-checking and information integrity across the web,”
      said Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan. “This effort has been highly collaborative, and we
      appreciate the support and guidance that we were given from the teams at AFP,
      Africa Check, BOOM and India Today in particular.”\n\nThe report offers the
      following core insights:\n\n#### Bots are the new audience engagement paradigm.
      \nA WhatsApp fact-Checking bot can serve three purposes: (1) help audiences
      understand how to interact with the fact-checking team and see commonly-requested
      content, (2) serve as a bridge between a human editor and someone submitting
      content to a tipline and (3) cut down on unactionable content.\n\n#### Machines
      in the loop augment quality human efforts.\nAlready designed for human work,
      Check now automates everything from content matching to intake, helping fact-checkers
      do their jobs more efficiently and therefore effectively.\n\n#### Follow the
      news cycle.\nNewsrooms learned that a topic-oriented approach to tipline promotion
      following the news cycle yields stronger audience engagement and submissions.
      After the outbreak of COVID-19, we saw an uptick in the percentage of quality,
      actionable content, in turn generating better fact-checks.\n\n#### Fact-checkers
      need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces in multiple languages.\nWe adapted our
      toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on the fact-checking rather rather than
      technical tasks. This enabled teams to customize their workflows.\n\n“We used
      to get inundated by the thousands of messages that people would send us on WhatsApp,”
      said Balkrishna, fact-checking editor at [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/).
      “Check has not only made it possible for us to sift through the fact-check requests
      quickly, it also helped deliver most of our readers with fast and personalized
      responses. This helps us build a direct bond of trust with our audience.” \n\n“Check
      really improved the way we communicate with our readers on WhatsApp,” said María
      Clara Pestre, a fact-checker at [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/) (Brazil).
      “Now, we can be sure anyone who reaches out through the app will have an immediate
      and consistent reply, while having time to dedicate ourselves to other parts
      of the verification process.”\n\n“We’re excited to work with partners like Meedan
      to help address the challenge of misinformation within private messaging. Our
      approach is to give users tools to easily get accurate information and support
      fact checking,” said Ben Supple, head of civic engagement at WhatsApp. “We appreciate
      and value the work done to maximize the WhatsApp Business API for fact checkers
      and ensure more people have access to accurate information at the click of a
      button.”\n\nMeedan presented this study at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
      with representatives from WhatsApp, the International Fact Checking Network,
      Boom and Africa Check. See the video from the panel here:\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe

      Shalini Joshi moderates a discussion about the evolution of fact-checking on
      WhatsApp at Global Fact 7</p>\n\nTo support this work, Meedan developed a number
      of key software features that maximized the WhatsApp Business API with a mix
      of AI, interface and multilingual innovations, including:\n\n- __Multilingual
      WhatsApp Bot:__ a customizable bot that presents both intuitive menu items and
      human conversations with fact-checkers in multiple languages\n- __Workflow Automation:__
      a triage system to recognize, review and prioritize claims and responses\n-
      __Similarity Analysis:__ algorithms that detect content patterns and trends
      based on variations of the same claims\n- __Response at Scale:__ a publishing
      system to send fact-check reports to tipline users who send duplicate or similar
      requests\n\n“Our goal with [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check),” explained
      Meedan’s Director of Product Pierre Conti, “is to build a scalable human and
      AI system for fact-checkers to efficiently size the demand for verification
      directly from their audience, cut through the noise, and maximize impact by
      helping them to prioritize their response to the most pressing misinformation.”"

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Today the health communications organization [Nigeria Health Watch](https://nigeriahealthwatch.com/)
      and Meedan announce a partnership to counter misinformation around COVID-19
      and other public health challenges in Nigeria. This partnership will take place
      through Meedan's [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/).
      \n\nThe spread of misinformation during disease outbreaks is a global issue.
      False or misleading information around disease prevention, treatment and cures
      can can cause confusion and panic, and can be dangerous to public health. There
      is there an urgent need for collaboration to address widespread health misinformation
      as governments tackle the double epidemic of misinformation and COVID-19.\n\nThrough
      the partnership, potentially false or misleading COVID-19 claims will be identified,
      and Nigeria Health Watch will leverage Meedan’s [team of experts](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/about/)
      to produce multimedia messages that debunk misinformation around the virus.
      The multimedia messages will include critical context and background information
      that is key to safely communicating debunks to misinformation. The project will
      apply insights from collated data to create evidence-based media campaigns to
      counter COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nManaging Director at Nigeria Health Watch,
      Vivianne Ihekweazu, said “Misinformation poses a threat to the public response
      to outbreaks, eroding the public’s trust, and their willingness and ability
      to take preventative measures.\" \n\n“As we’re learning each day, information
      and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems
      as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world. Strained access
      to health experts during emergencies, such as the one we’re experiencing, can
      quickly lead to poor health outcomes, as low-quality information exacerbates
      the real-world spread of disease,” said Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab
      lead. \n\n#### About Nigeria Health Watch\nNigeria Health Watch uses informed
      advocacy and communication to influence health policy and seek better health
      and access to healthcare in Nigeria. We seek to amplify some of the great work
      happening in the health sector, challenge the bad, and create a space for positive
      ideas and action. Through its various platforms, Nigeria Health Watch is a trusted
      source that provides informed commentary and in-depth analysis of health issues
      in Nigeria, always in good conscience. \n\n#### About Meedan\nMeedan is a technology

    body: "In today’s increasingly online world, social media has become a source
      for news—often in compressed visual form. Widely circulated images have the
      power to shape opinions and alter actions. Sometimes they’re funny. Sometimes
      they’re informative. But what happens when memes are used to intentionally transmit
      disinformation (information that is false and deliberately created to cause
      harm)? How are people supposed to know what’s true and what’s false?\n \nIf
      the distinction seems trivial, it’s not. Elections and lives hang in the balance
      of finding a way to solve this problem in an efficient and effective manner.
      That’s why Meedan received funding from the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/)
      (OTF) in 2019 to help develop the Claims and Memes Database (CMDb)—a programmer-accessible
      repository of fact-checked claims and debunked visual misinformation intended
      to combat this new type of information control. The CMDb project was overseen
      by Meedan program manager [Wafaa Heikal](https://meedan.com/blog/meet-our-regional-program-managers-apac-latin-america-and-africa/).
      \n \n \n#### SETTING THE STAGE\n### The rise of the intentional use of misinformation
      online\n \nMeedan has long worked at the forefront of improving the quality
      and equity of online information. One of the main ways it does so is through
      the organization’s flagship software, [Check](https://meedan.com/check). This
      free and [open-source](https://github.com/meedan/check) collaborative workflow
      software helps users verify digital photos and text, build datasets, and structure
      open-source investigations. An early iteration of the software played a key
      role for citizen journalists during the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Five years
      later, over 1,000 journalists used Check’s collaborative verification structure
      to help monitor and detect voting issues in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
      Today, over 250 workspaces created by more than 1,750 users around the world
      now rely on Check to fact-check and investigate online information. Their efforts,
      and the stories they have helped produce, have made a tangible difference in
      the way global citizen media is relied upon and viewed.\n \nBut by 2019, with
      repressive regimes ramping up their own efforts to weaponize visual misinformation
      as a tool for social network manipulation, voter suppression, and censorship,
      it became clear that the Check platform required an upgrade. Journalists needed
      to be able to more efficiently verify or debunk memes. And citizens needed to
      be able to receive that fact-checked information in a more expeditious manner.
      So, with the funding from OTF’s Core Infrastructure Fund, Meedan set out to
      build the CMDb and enhance Check’s infrastructure.\n \n \n#### TRUE OR FALSE—EXPLAINED\n###
      Inside Meedan’s revolutionary verification software Check\n \nBefore diving
      into the details of the CMDb project, it’s best to understand how Check works.\n
      \nThe software helps journalists, researchers, and civil society organizations
      gather and verify digital information through a uniquely customizable process.
      After a Check team creates their project workspace, they set-up how they will
      receive submissions for verification. These submissions can be images, text,
      a combination of images and text (memes), or videos. For example in India, the
      Checkpoint project allowed for submissions by providing WhatsApp users with
      a phone number to which they could text rumors, claims, or memes for verification.
      Other submission processes include collaborating with local partners in North
      Africa and West Asia to crowdsource investigative evidence of human rights violations
      (to be sent to the [UC Berkeley Human Rights Investigations Lab)](https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab)
      or working with students and journalists to help monitor elections in Tunisia.\n
      \nOnce these submissions are uploaded to Check, the verification process begins.
      Throughout it all, Meedan works with partners to shape their tasks and workflows
      based on the project’s specific needs. During verification, users (such as journalists
      or human rights researchers) review a submission and work to determine the claim’s
      origin and accuracy. Annotation options allow reviewers to provide in-depth
      analysis and tags. After all tasks are completed for a submission, a verdict
      is determined (these are customizable and often include correct, incorrect,
      or misleading). In certain situations, this verdict can then be transmitted
      back to the individual who submitted the claim.\n \n \n#### ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY\n###
      CMDb developments streamline the verification process for thousands of Check
      users\n \nEven just a brief overview of the verification process reveals how
      incredibly time-consuming it can be. With thousands of claims being submitted
      to election-monitoring projects, how can reviewers possibly verify each one?\n
      \nShort answer: They can’t. And the reviewers can’t provide the results fast
      enough to combat voter suppression and protect electoral integrity. But there
      is a way to streamline the process—that’s why Meedan applied to OTF to develop
      the CMDb.\n \nThe technology built for the CMDb allowed Meedan to develop better
      workflows for annotating claims and images on Check. These developments will
      help improve research and machine-learning processes in both the short and long
      term. OTF’s funding also allowed the Meedan team to build new features to better
      respond to memetic misinformation—like Check’s report designer, which enables
      journalists to quickly develop compelling visual responses to help stem the
      spread of misinformation online. New tools for processing content, like importing
      spreadsheets and ingesting content submitted from closed networks, were also
      developed with the support.\n \nIn addition to enhancing user ease, the CMDb
      project significantly improved Meedan’s image and claim similarity infrastructure.
      The newly developed claim/image matching technology enables similar images and
      claims to be clustered—making a verifier’s work far easier. By identifying secondary
      items that are related to a submitted claim, this matching technology allows
      for similar images and memes to automatically receive the same tagging, annotation,
      and verdict as the original image or meme. This technological advancement produced
      immediate efficiencies. Journalists are now able to cluster hundreds of similar
      images and claims and respond to misinformation in a collective manner (saving
      massive amounts of time and effort).\n \n \n#### EXPANDED OUTREACH\n### Immediate
      application of CMDb technology and OTF funds enable Meedan to expand its global
      impact\n \nMeedan quickly put the newly developed CMDb technology to use. The
      streamlined content workflows and image matching technology helped support dozens
      of newsrooms and fact-checking organizations during the 2019 elections in India,
      Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n \n__India__: In response to misinformation
      circulating in closed networks in India, Meedan partnered with [Pop-Up Newsroom](https://popup.news/),
      WhatsApp, and [Proto](https://www.pro.to/) (a civic media studio) on the massive
      and innovative research endeavor, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/).
      The effort used Check Message, Meedan’s WhatsApp integration, to conduct research
      to better understand the ways by which misinformation spreads on WhatsApp.\n
      \n__Indonesia__: [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/)
      worked in collaboration with Meedan and the news consultancy [Fathm](https://www.fathm.co/)
      to help journalism schools, newsrooms, and fact-checking organizations in Indonesia
      collaborate and verify claims during and leading up to the 2019 elections. The
      initiative, which resembled [Meedan’s 2016 Electionland effort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhD379ggq54&feature=emb_title)
      in the United States, was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta.\n \n__Philippines__:
      Meedan teamed up with local partners in the Philippines to create [Tsek.ph](https://tsek.ph/)—a
      new collaborative fact-checking journalistic initiative (Tsek means “Check”
      in Filipino). The project brought together 11 news organizations and three universities
      in an effort to counter disinformation and provide verified information related
      to the country’s midterm elections. Throughout the year, Meedan also continued
      its work with VeraFiles and Rappler, two pioneers of fact-checking and verification
      in the Philippines.\n \nSupport from OTF in 2019 also enabled Meedan to lead
      various informational workshops around the globe showcasing the CMDb project
      and providing journalists with a better understanding of the power—for good,
      and for bad—of global memes and claims. Various aspects of the CMDb’s research
      were presented by Meedan's Director of Research, Scott Hale, at the International
      Multimodal Communication Centre, University of Oxford, the Okinawa Institute
      for Science and Technology, and the CCSS School on Computational Social Science
      at the University of Kobe. \n\nMeedan’s Director of Engineering, Caio Almeida,
      [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Bs713r-i-lAPj6uPwqreX8QvNQ0EW_TnoEuN3dF6V0/edit#slide=id.p)
      a research paper, [Text Similarity Using Word Embeddings to Classify Fake News](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2607/short4.pdf),
      at the [Workshop on Digital Humanities and Natural Language Processing](https://propor.di.uevora.pt/)
      collocated with the International Conference on the Computational Processing
      of Portuguese (PROPOR 2020). The paper describes the new, open-source architecture
      Meedan developed to use word embeddings at scale with Elasticsearch in order
      to analyse the similarity of short textual items and identify near duplicates.
      A second research paper evaluating the text and image matching performance is
      currently in preparation.\n \nWhile contributing to research efforts, Meedan
      also provided input to Facebook, Twitter, and Google regarding the best approaches
      to the use of misleading manipulated and synthetic imagery on social media platforms.
      This feedback was taken into consideration when Twitter drafted new guidelines
      on manipulated media. Additionally, as part of the [W3C Credible Web Community
      Group](https://credweb.org/), Meedan contributed to the development of a list
      of indicators for content credibility, including images. And, as part of the
      [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/), members of Meedan
      helped form the Responding to Memes and Images working group to further address
      credibility indicators for images and memes.\n \n \n#### DATA DRAWBACKS\n###
      Complications emerge surrounding data sharing and sensitivity\n \nDespite the
      significant progress achieved during the CMDb’s first year, the project was
      not without its difficulties. Obstacles arose pertaining to the data collected
      by partners using Check’s software. Ideally, the images and claims that comprise
      the CMDb would be able to be shared publicly. But doing so creates a host of
      ethical concerns and legal issues regarding terms of service, varying privacy
      policies, and the very real threat of revealing personal information. Meedan
      worked with Harvard Law School’s [Cyberlaw Clinic](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/clinical/clinics/cyberlaw-clinic/)
      on terms that enable us to conduct research on this data while protecting personally
      identifiable information and user privacy. Options such as data trusts, in which
      a legally separate trust would own the underlying data, are also being explored.
      These efforts are critical, as finding a way to make the database accessible
      to other users—and one day even the general public—would help further curb the
      spread of misinformation online.\n \nAnother obstacle that emerged during the
      project was psychological. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the investigations
      conducted using Check, images can be highly graphic and therefore traumatizing
      for people to review. At this time, image and text matching technology can only
      reduce—not eliminate—the need for human judgement. That means in cases of human
      rights violations, an individual must still personally view the submitted image.
      Such work involves serious mental health challenges and risks like PTSD. Meedan
      is working to better understand these problems and provide the necessary resources
      to support the journalists and fact-checkers in these roles. Although new developments,
      like the option to flag and filter unwanted images, provide possible mitigation
      options—this issue needs more attention and may not be able to be solved by
      technology alone.\n \n \n#### LOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n### What’s next for Meedan,
      Check, and the CMDb?\n \nMeedan’s work to build a publicly accessible global
      claims and memes database is far from over. Data sharing issues must be resolved,
      language barriers must be overcome, and the matching technology must continue
      to be improved. Nonetheless, the first year of the CMDb project was a resounding
      success. Technology developed for the project is already in use, saving critical
      time and effort for journalists and human rights activists in the verification
      process. Much was also learned about the ways by which disinformation spreads
      across the internet. In response, an infrastructure was established that one
      day will be able to prevent debunked claims and memes from traveling across
      countries and time (known as “zombie misinformation,” these false rumors originate
      in one context and continue to permeate the internet despite being “killed off”—debunked—in
      their original country/time).\n \nFor now, Meedan has focused its efforts on
      combating the spread of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like
      the virus itself, misinformation pertaining to “cures” or “treatments” is spreading
      around the world and causing real harm. Meedan is committed to making its full
      toolkit and code available to help improve trust, information quality, and research
      capabilities. The organization’s development of the CMDb, and its history of
      fighting to advance accurate information online, make it uniquely positioned
      to help during this critical time. As a critical first step, Meedan introduced
      the [Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/)—a
      customizable COVID-19 WhatsApp bot for fact-checkers tackling the wave of misinformation
      surrounding the virus.  The [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      which contains a database of expert-sourced COVID-19 information, has been built
      to help support verification processes.\n \nNow, as repressive regimes continue
      to expand their use of misinformation online, and COVID-19 rumors threaten to
      wreak havoc on public health, Meedan’s work is more important than ever. Memes
      are no longer a laughing matter. Lives truly hang in the balance of determining
      what’s true and what’s false."
