    In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

    Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

    ## Check in India

    In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

    ![A snapshot of Check in action in India](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7ByjlM8ANw0DQKaFgilv7k/75663509b60dee23c990ceea2696068a/check-in-india.png)

    In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

    The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

    In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months. For more about Checkpoint, [click here](https://medium.com/@meedan/press-release-new-whatsapp-tip-line-launched-to-understand-and-respond-to-misinformation-during-f4fce616adf4).

    ## Check in Indonesia

    In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

    Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

    > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

    ## Check in the Philippines

    The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

    The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
    “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

    In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

    Conversations on family WhatsApp groups in India can be exhausting. *“Your bank has gone bust. Its share prices have dropped. Before you lose your life savings, find a reliable bank and transfer all your money.”* My anxious family members shared this message on one of our many family WhatsApp groups.

    The language and style of the message looked dubious to me. A few inquiries and one good fact-check relieved me: My bank was safe! Before I could share the good news on the family group, there was another forward that family members did not want anyone to miss. A big chocolate brand was gifting free chocolate hampers for Diwali! Before I could alert family members to not fall for the new hoax, there was mayhem on the group. The number of chocolate boxes purportedly being gifted increased with each message! So my little alert was buried in an avalanche of chocolate discussion among very excited young and old members of my family.

    Studies have shown that trust in the person sharing a message on closed messaging apps like WhatsApp is a key indicator of the message being shared multiple times. It is because of this trust that even suspicious looking messages are spread. I often talk with friends about this; *“What is the right strategy to call out family members sending fake news on WhatsApp groups?” “I can’t stop being Judge Judy on my family WhatsApp groups and people hate me for that.” “The last time I told my uncle his message was fake, he made a nasty comment and ignored me at the next family gathering.”*

    From first-hand experience running newsrooms, I can tell you that fact-checkers in India face similar concerns to my friends and I. I once met a media marketing manager who managed 60 WhatsApp groups. I wondered how he kept track of important messages. Shortly after that interaction, my newsroom went from print to digital, and I found myself on at least 40 WhatsApp groups that had media persons and other local professionals. The barrage of good morning messages did not stop until early evening. Group members were happy to share all kinds of unsolicited advice about personal or professional issues. Birthdays and anniversaries are big in India, and wishes, memes, songs on these occasions started from midnight and never ended! Amidst all this, fake information filtered into these groups as well. It was nearly impossible to keep track of conversations and information.

    What is the solution to this? Will we just learn to live surrounded by a fog of noise and misinformation?

    *“There’s a lot of noise on WhatsApp. Ignoring it is not an option; this is the pulse of conversations around us today. Addressing it is a challenge because of the clutter.”* My conversations with fact-checkers in India indicate high levels of exhaustion just from monitoring incoming messages on WhatsApp. Many of them work with limited resources and small teams. Managing a helpline on WhatsApp is not easy; from employment related inquiries to requests for setting up appointments with celebrities — fact-checkers have dealt with it all. There’s also video calls from users at all hours, pornographic content, trolls, these are also concerns flagged by fact-checkers in India.

    So how do fact-checking initiatives cope with this? Well…

    - Some have had to discontinue their helplines
    - Others have to scroll through several messages to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones
    - Fact-checkers are also relying on other social media platforms to look for relevant information to address. “We can’t not address misinformation on WhatsApp”, the last fact-checker I met said.

    #### Check is here to help!

    Meedan’s digital tool, Check, has features that can provide solutions to messages on closed apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was introduced to Check last year when I learned about Verificado, a collaborative election reporting and fact-checking project in Mexico. In March this year I was actively using Check while working on Checkpoint, a research project around the 2019 Indian general election where Check integrated with the WhatsApp Business API.

    As a Check journalist, there are many tasks that the tool simplified

    - I didn’t have to look at a WhatsApp number everyday to find relevant election related messages
    - It was possible for me to collaborate with other team members, even those members who were not physically present in the same space, because we all had access to the same feed
    - Finding important messages buried in a heap of junk also became easier because of Check
    - Keeping track of work and looking at patterns of misinformation was another task where different features of Check came in handy.

    I saw the potential of Check to perform many more tasks to help fact-checkers, journalists, activists and researchers. As a team member leading Meedan’s work in the Asia Pacific region, I am now engaging with new partners and introducing Check to their workflows. I understand the concerns of journalists and fact-checkers well, and some of their concerns are now on the roadmap for Meedan’s team to improve Check and enhance its features. As a Meedan team member, I understand how Check can be positioned in the work of organizations and how its existing features can be applied effectively. It’s a dynamic relationship and it’s a good place to be in.

    Before I joined Meedan as a software engineer in late 2011, this amazing team had already noticed that new media was ending the scarcity in which mass media journalism functioned. This was having repercussions for both newsgathering and publishing—no longer were audiences solely reliant on foreign reporters to tell the story. This was particularly true of the reporting of the Middle East, where citizen media been used so powerfully in the midst of such colossal social and political change during the Arab Spring. And citizen media should be verified.

    That’s when Meedan started working on this problem — clearly a very difficult nut to crack. It all started with a participatory liveblog with leading Egyptian independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.

    ![The Early Days: Checkdesk 1.0](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1pyqrBpzaGsslnQzRhWQbq/99411e1d90054d975042df1d3243377a/1_vhGxiy0adssnlxAxPYO91Q.png)

    Less than one year after I joined Meedan, around October 2012, the software engineering team (myself included) started working on a second iteration of this platform for collaborative fact-checking, which at that point was called Checkdesk, which we launched in July 2013.

    Checkdesk was a verification desk for the digital newsroom, designed to help curate user-generated content during breaking news and to connect journalists to citizen sources on the ground. We developed it in cooperation with six leading media outlets in the MENA region: Al Masry Al Youm and Welad El Balad Media Services in Egypt, 7iber in Jordan, Nahar Ashabab and Social Media Exchange (SMEX) in Lebanon, Ma’an Network in Palestine, and Al-Ayyam in Syria.

    ![Checkdesk 2.0 in action by Bellingcat](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/5hGviBzBImRaJ9H6kj2QvJ/6f2de5304cc654ba0983ec1a96bab305/1_v1g4OUFLKHmvwSv_ChhYRQ.gif)

    From a technological perspective, Checkdesk was built as a monolithic web application using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), an open source platform for web content management. As a CMS, Drupal was among the most successful and seemed like a great fit for our needs, because it strikes a great balance between getting up and running in no time, and the ability to extend its functionality almost infinitely. It served us quite well between 2013 and early 2016 and during that time we had the opportunity to [make numerous contributions to its community](https://www.drupal.org/node/2343639) and attend some Drupal conferences to share all the expertise we gained with that work.

    As our applications grew, we started facing scalability challenges with Drupal. These challenges manifested in many ways, from code maintainability to lower performance, proliferation of defects and automated testing. It was time for us to rethink our software architecture. We had to implement more features, go mobile, support more languages, handle more content, serve more users and face new social events—mainly elections.

    We accepted a big challenge at that time, which was to completely rewrite Checkdesk, in six months, from scratch, with a completely new code base.

    Personally, I had some good pre-Meedan experience with the open source web application framework [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) since 2009. During my early days at Meedan I had the opportunity to implement a prototype in Ruby On Rails for social media translation, which was called Translatedesk. This prototype evolved into a micro services architecture made of several Ruby On Rails APIs which were at the core of our translation product, [Bridge](https://meedan.com/en/bridge/).

    So we decided to pursue a similar software stack approach as Bridge and re-implemented Checkdesk as a multi-service application: some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs written in Ruby On Rails, a web application using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and, as usual, everything was released [as an open source project](https://github.com/meedan/check). We also started a new culture for our software development process, which includes writing automated tests for everything seeking [100% code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa/code), [continuous testing](http://travis-ci.org/meedan), [code quality with maximum GPA at Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa) and containerization of our softwares.

    Not only the code was rewritten, but also the branding: Checkdesk was brought out from behind the ‘desk.’ The 3.0 version of our open source software was rebranded as, simply, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    ![Checkdesk 3.0, a.k.a. Check](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1Dkor8b2zPH26RZptleGDl/da47acfd15d8a1a4ec964482baa491fb/1_pcz3ZoK-tD_C9gnM2CCpnw.png)

    Check provides a central workbench facilitating online verification newsroom collaboration, allowing participating journalists and editors a simple and powerful framework to work together to investigate and annotate links, media and claims. This new code base has been serving us well since then, and during that time we implemented many improvements, new features and performance enhancements in order to accommodate its increasing usage. Since we first released it in October 2016, it was used by OJA-winning election monitoring projects like [Electionland](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/checking-the-vote-how-check-was-used-during-electionland-4242dd875e4b) (United States, 2016), [CrossCheck](https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.org/france-fr/) (France, 2017) and [Verificado](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/verificado-2018-wins-major-collaboration-and-partnerships-award-e6812ecbbdf) (Mexico, 2018), in addition to similar projects in Asia, namely [Indonesia, Philippines and India](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/meedan-in-asia-how-check-supported-three-simultaneous-election-reporting-initiatives-9b6626e89e3a).

    In India we had a new big challenge to face: misinformation on WhatsApp. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/). In December 2018 we started to integrate Check into the WhatsApp business API and released this feature in early April 2019, just in time for the elections in India. Check Message was born: our tool for fact-checking against disinformation at scale, seeking scalability, reliability and great performance.

    ![Check Message architecture](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4YDeFFaKebhPeh3N1xAt9p/f3f144a5e8ebbd10c083377b3db57b89/1_QEFoJ2yG5LvjfQVew-oPyA.png)

    Our collaboration in India, called [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched in April as the first real use case of Check Message. In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification and our software was useful to group duplicate requests, allow similar items to be related, prioritize most requested items and, in general, optimize the fact-checker’s work as much as possible.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    After this first release, we generalized our software module from WhatsApp-specific to more platform-agnostic, and we now support other closed message platforms, like Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. This module was implemented as a Check bot. Check allows for extensible scripts and functions that help you augment your verification experience with tools like private messenger integration, archiving and language detection. We call these scripts [bots](https://github.com/meedan/check-bots), and they live in the [Bot Garden](https://medium.com/meedan-user-guides/bot-garden-user-guide-adc2c1d743f3). We hope that this bot infrastructure can be used by other developers around the world to integrate Check with other tools and with their own workflows.

    We keep working on Check in order to improve user experience, content ingestion and augmented verification. Stay tuned! What I can say is that I’m really enjoying the things we are working on right now and really excited for the next challenges we’ll face and the new software support we’ll implement in the upcoming years in order to make Check even more global. I invite everyone to join us on that. If you are a software developer interested in open source and in these challenges we’re tackling, get in touch on [GitHub](http://github.com/meedan). If you are journalist and want to use Check for your project, get in touch with us on our [website](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    Ultimately, it’s a collaborative effort.

  body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
    misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
    content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
    since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
    published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election, to
    the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
    before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
    (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
    the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
    credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
    an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of it
    are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how to
    communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for content
    credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
    to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
    of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an initiative
    with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community group (CredWeb).
    [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
    (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
    to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
    documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
    to this issue.\n\n#### [Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment
    on the Web](https://credweb.org/report/20181011)\n\nThis is a vision document
    that captures a general technical approach for improving credibility assessment
    online. It captures everything from terminology to threat models and stakeholders,
    and it lays out some of our core vision for the potential of these standards.
    It’s a hefty lift, and we recommend taking some time to look through it and offer
    commentary.\n\nHere’s how it starts:\n\n*Can you tell, when looking at a random
    web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search
    results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are
    scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed
    and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda or outright lies?
    Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making
    some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods with
    your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making
    bad decisions for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous
    consequences?*\n\n*The Credible Web Community Group was formed at W3C, the organization
    which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological approaches
    to this “credibility assessment” problem. It’s not that we think technology can
    solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one,
    but it seems likely that some technology is making matters worse and that certain
    designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches
    to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.*\n\n\n#### [Credibility
    Signals](https://credweb.org/signals/)\n\nAfter reading through the above, it
    helps to dive into specifics. What do signals look like? In this document, we
    have an outline of some draft signals. They range from signals around rhetoric
    — does it show negative or positive valence? — to a typology around clickbait
    and what it means for a title to accurately represent the body content.\n\nHere’s
    how we frame the document:\n\n*This document is intended to support an ecosystem
    of interoperable credibility tools. These software tools, which may be components
    of familiar existing systems, will gather, process, and use relevant data to help
    people more accurately decide what information they can trust online and protect
    themselves from being misled. We expect that an open data-sharing architecture
    will facilitate efficient research and development, as well as an overall system
    which is more visibly trustworthy.*\n\n*The document has three primary audiences:*\n\n-
    *Software developers and computer science researchers wanting to build systems
    which work with credibility data. For them, the document aims to be a precise
    technical specification, stating what they need for their software to interoperate
    with any other software which conforms to this specification.*\n- *People who
    work in journalism and want to review and contribute to this technology sphere,
    to help make sure it is beneficial and practical.*\n- *Non-computer-science researchers,
    interested in helping develop and improve the science behind this work.*\n\nWe’re
    grateful to the many many participants who gave feedback on these documents in
    their early stages, and we’re looking forward to advancing them in our second
    year as a group. If you’re coming to [CredCon](http://www.credcon.org/), be sure
    to join our workshops and chat with CredWeb co-chair Sandro Hawke. Or, learn more
    about joining the group at [credweb.org](http://credweb.org/).\n\n\n\n\n"

    Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

    ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

    We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

    ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

    Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

    ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

    With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

    ![“Aerial Photos of flooding caused by Hurricane Florence” by S.C. Air National Guard](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3FLP519tmwF4fE0nWhoYaB/0747fcb183e0af1ddabf57d2e4c086d8/1_WUPR5tVJFJ_Z-X9hEhkPFQ.jpeg)

    ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

    The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

    ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

    Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.

  body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
    of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,

    challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training sessions,
    host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and have network
    partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people, crossing borders,
    gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly global collaboration
    to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a global anti(in-person)-gathering.
    In Meedan terms: the future of our global town squares is dependent on our near
    term efforts to keep our physical town squares empty, and our digital town squares
    free of dangerous misinformation. \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19
    pandemic we are addressing the immediate needs of a global team and also working
    to develop programs that contribute to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing
    the lead of some other [inspiring organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
    \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and personal
    paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose school has
    been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members. We have closed
    our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have put a hold on
    the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.   \n\nLast week
    we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support for their health
    and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans, budgets, and project
    timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent and encouragement
    of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development Cooperation Agency.
    \ \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses. Last year we launched
    the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to health information as
    a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and Nat Gyenes framed some
    of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient piece in the Atlantic, [How
    Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
    \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous international
    bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable areas for
    civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with epidemiologists,
    public health communications experts, technology companies, and civil society
    partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository of annotated
    misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of our Check Global,
    Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies into this new program
    area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible threat to our emotional
    and physical well-being, I want to close this brief statement by saying perhaps
    this global project to stay apart might actually serve to bring together a world
    that is riven politically and ideologically. It’s going to take some brilliant
    and heroic collaborations to make it through the next several months and we are
    committed to doing what we can as an organization placed at the epicenter of misinformation
    response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist? Public Health Expert? Talented
    Engineer? [Post-doc Researcher](https://meedan.com/jobs/research-fellow/ \"Meedan
    Job Posting\")? Email us at hello@meedan.com if you want to lend a hand with the
    formidable task of getting high quality COVID-19 info onto the interwebs while
    we rebuild this plane inflight and work through a new way of running a coronavirus
    resistant organization.\n\nEAB<br/>\nMarch 16, 2020<br/>\nWoodacre, CA"

  body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work remotely
    most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity for journalists,
    fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of COVID–19, the novel
    coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences focusing on Internet
    freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check), the
    project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
    from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
    Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in COVID-19-related
    content, and  public health and science communication experts have been helping
    us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to ensure  accurate information
    can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate health information usually
    spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities at risk, but this year it’s more
    critical for us to accomplish what we usually do at conferences. While we are
    disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues in person, there’s an opportunity
    here. There have always been many reasons to have a virtual conference, but now
    there are more people and organizations motivated to do something about it - there
    are entire industries going virtual. At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity
    and inclusion amongst both staff and partners. If we work on this issue during
    a pandemic, we can make conferences more accessible for everyone as a long term
    goal too. Participants from emerging economies often have difficulty getting visas
    to attend conferences. Global climate change has led several people to forgo airplane
    travel. Parents have to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some
    disabilities make travel difficult, and the disability activism community has
    long called for improvements to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote
    participation has been used by several conferences to enable attendance for people
    who cannot travel. While this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual
    conferences are not widespread, and they lack virtual versions of useful conference
    activities. Many of the open source tools we use were designed by covering walls
    in a massive number of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What
    do you need from a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions?
    What works for you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe
    started with the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2.
    Presenting product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5.
    One-on-one discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7.
    Un-conference formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe
    came up with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked
    at were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
    budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
    high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
    indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
    thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
    has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a disability,
    however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is not an option
    at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling. As long
    as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate with other
    participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant lives in a region
    or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection. Any virtual conference
    technology has to take low bandwidth environments into account.\n\n3. This participant
    has a passport or legal status that makes it difficult for them to travel. They
    often get rejected for visas, even when they are a featured speaker at a conference.
    \n\n3. This participant lives in a country that censors the Internet and arrests
    journalists. In order to participate safely, they can only go to conferences with
    a no photo or video policy, whether this is a blanket ban or attendee preferences
    can be signaled by the color of their conference lanyard. Any virtual conference
    technology must allow private access, allowances for pseudonyms, participation
    without voice or video, and possibly compatibility with censorship circumvention
    technologies.\n\n4. This participant is Deaf. Their technology needs may include
    live captioning, participation by typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video
    of presenters to enable lip reading, or clear audio from participants depending
    on their level of hearing and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant
    is blind. Virtual conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers,
    and presenters should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of
    their presentation materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems
    understanding one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation,
    or just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
    participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the presentation.
    They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the ability to ask questions
    of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who need mobility aids face obstacles
    when traveling. Wheelchair users often get broken chairs back from airlines. When
    these chairs are custom fit, there are no temporary replacements that can make
    participating in a conference a pain-free experience. Power wheelchairs are very
    expensive, so travel can mean gambling with one’s mobility for a long time after
    a conference. \n\n9. This participant has modest tech skills and may need help
    with operating the interface for online meetings. Usability is an access issue.
    \n\nWe’re working with our communities to make lasting change out of this emergency
    situation. The civic tech community is evaluating software and practices for conferences
    and hackathons. We’re also expanding our online developer community. Let’s build
    something together! \n\nEmail us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>

  body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
    of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
    ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
    to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso, and
    Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with newsrooms,
    fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three continents.\n\nThis
    represents significant growth from previous years, allowing us to deepen our support
    for these regions with program leads who are deeply familiar with their local
    contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our amazing partners around the
    world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional leads, along with Wafaa Heikal,
    our long-running program manager who is now heading up our efforts in Africa and
    the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi
    is passionate about feminism and local journalism. Over the last two decades,
    her work has brought the two together. Shalini has studied misinformation, particularly
    on closed messaging platforms. She has been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International
    Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/) ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)).
    The fellowship focused on designing creative ways to counter misinformation. As
    a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/), ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini
    led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/) - a research project focused
    on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini started her professional
    journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/), a centre for gender education.
    She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented communities to come
    into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes. Shalini is
    the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (“News Waves”
    in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya is known
    for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women from some
    of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project is a testament
    to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent media is essential,
    as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini believes that
    [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can be a turning point
    for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation shared on closed messaging
    platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate, annotate, verify and archive
    misinformation and Shalini believes that for several small and independent newsrooms,
    this is a great service that no other platform currently provides. Check has tremendous
    potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers to design collaborative projects, especially
    around areas of common interest. Its unique features are great for large projects
    on politics, health, climate change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n###
    Meet Isabella Barroso in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa,
    is Meedan's Latin America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms
    in both Spanish and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's
    program team with a passion for human-centred design and product development that
    is fit to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design,
    Isa hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills
    in product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
    journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
    [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
    and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am now
    developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\" noted
    Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned a lot
    about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this happens
    with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America seems to
    be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging on
    closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
    overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
    Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in journalism.
    She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy to literature.
    \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with culture and social
    media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first job was as a culture
    journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
    due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
    came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
    of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
    I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
    open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
    the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
    media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
    with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news cycle.
    In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor and
    verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human rights
    researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
    annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
    open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support different
    workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate and what
    context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work across an
    interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with small teams
    and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring projects, understanding
    the particular national context and partner capacities and then designing new
    workflows around them.”\n\n"

  body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives is
    one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
    with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
    and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
    expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
    information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
    health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
    fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and time
    at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This ensures
    that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time. Including
    specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization hosts
    daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries may
    change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the exact
    point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2. Be
    context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
    For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
    about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
    to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only. This
    ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
    and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular treatments
    have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information you
    use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information you
    have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed to
    publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
    such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
    This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
    information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
    with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
    a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
    to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
    our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
    health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
    is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
    and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
    a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
    for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
    Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical recommendations
    to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with that. If there
    are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants answered, they
    can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:  \n\n>   “If you're
    looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare provider, and   be sure
    to review the World Health Organization website for more information about COVID-19:
    https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs the COVID-19
    pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents and screens, drastically
    impacting public health, our way of life and global markets, Meedan is also reflecting
    on this historic moment and its emerging lessons: In the coming weeks we will
    be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19, written by journalists, fact-checkers,
    censorship experts, thought leaders and academics. The contributors are writing
    about the pandemic through the fog of the war— filing reports and analyses as
    news is still breaking, long before we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe
    analyses will aim to shine a light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship,
    localization of information access, and public trust, as we start to think about
    moving forward and away from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this
    in our newsletter and on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against
    viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore,
    antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However,
    if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because
    bacterial co-infection is possible\"\n\n"

  body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
    massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
    Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
    support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
    researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
    a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
    and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
    infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material for
    journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize pandemic-related
    information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can present a bottleneck
    for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies, when demand
    for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the Harvard School
    of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have been researching
    how health information inequity and digital health misinformation can impact the
    spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps that can exacerbate
    those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
    on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care. \n\nIt
    is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic, that
    two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
    and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
    health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research and
    epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious disease
    researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively to a
    wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
    is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
    CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
    and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
    — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the second
    challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is supplying
    important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan to utilize
    ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate can be shared
    readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database into fact-checking
    bot workflows that many of our partners are already using to source questions
    from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to either access existing
    resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries to be fact-checked.
    This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations directly, and
    providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable initiatives
    being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health ministries
    around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality information
    through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative, Twitter,
    Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency and the
    Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered around
    six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access to experts
    can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities to access
    reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is populated and
    regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly sourced questions
    and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental health
    organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs during
    the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global network
    of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain the
    database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers and
    communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
    COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
    public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
    required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue to
    collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies and
    evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact assessment,
    monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design. In addition
    to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate to be working
    with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City University, as
    well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the behavioral impact
    of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database priorities and
    content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist COVID-19 response
    effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative  to bridge research
    and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators. We are developing
    templates for packaged, verified content that can be included in outputs sent
    from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded in behavior science
    and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of care for communications,
    and include best practices for addressing health information response challenges,
    such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and transparency in the ever-changing
    information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__ We are prioritizing pathways
    for disseminating contents of the database across languages to fact-checkers and
    pandemic communicators around the world. We are also integrating into Meedan’s
    open source verification and fact-checking workspace software, Check, in order
    to make its expert-reviewed contents available to the public. Through Check, we
    are creating an interface for users to design custom multilingual bots for disseminating
    their fact-checked content, connecting users to closed messaging networks including
    Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then
    be able to access a subset of relevant resources, selected by each fact-checking
    organization individually, via a simple query system, and will be presented with
    short lists of up-to-date content that matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__
    Through this project, we are examining the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions
    across languages and geographies, exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation,
    and translating findings into useful insights for public health communicators.
    In addition, as a group that works closely with partners in emerging economies,
    Meedan is closely following the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people
    living in densely populated urban areas and underserved communities that don't
    have access to public health care systems. Our team members in different regions
    are tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence
    against women, and insights will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning
    each day, information and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading
    in online ecosystems as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world.
    During this historic time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical
    questions about everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious
    disease research. Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer
    questions about complex health information, medical research and epidemiological
    findings, while public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers
    struggle to urgently communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The
    result of this problem set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor
    health outcomes, as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world
    spread of disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure
    on fact-checking organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience
    to health experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including
    research on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and
    the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
    Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped much
    of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of Meedan’s
    Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal of promoting
    health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six years, these
    ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night dinners and graduate
    school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu brainstorming, in
    sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival, the Digital Health
    @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News Initiative Summits,
    in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics, mixed methods, and human
    rights lectures, and in conversations between friends and colleagues, hopeful
    in our ability to create something important together. I am immensely grateful
    to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make the most of our work together,
    and to all of our supporters as we further develop this intersection.\n\nThis
    COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without the partnership and collaboration
    of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural Insights Team, Birmingham City
    University, students and researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health
    and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and our network of public health
    specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this initiative, we are keen to learn
    and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the challenging
    and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators are doing to address this
    pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please reach out at health@meedan.com
    to talk more.\n"

    ومنطقة آسيا التي تطل على المحيط الهادئ.  \n\nوتهدف هذه المنح إلى دعم مشاريع تدقيق
    الحقائق والتحقق من الأخبار والمعلومات ومبادرات المراقبة المحلية وتوثيق يوميات
    الواقع المحلي  للمجتمعات الخاضعة للحجر الصحي وحملات التربية الإعلامية والرقمية
    وتعقب أثر منع التجول على الأنظمة الديمقراطية، وفحص تأثير الجائحة على آليات المراقبة
    التقنية، ورأسمالية المراقبة والحقوق المدنية والعنف ضد المرأة فيما يتعلق بفيروس
    كوفيد-19. وبالتالي، فإننا نشجع المتقدمين على الإبداع في مقترحاتهم. وإننا حريصون
    على دعم إنتاج أنواع مختلفة من المشروعات بما فيها البودكاست (البث الصوتي الرقمي)
    والفيديوهات والوثائقيات والمؤلفات والحملات ومجموعات الأدوات والأرشيفات الرقمية
    والتدوين. كما نتطلع إلى دعم المقترحات التي لا تركز فقط على تغطية المعلومات المضللة
    حول الجائحة، بل أيضاً النظر في حياة الناس وتجاربهم أثناء الحجر الصحي.\n\nنحن حالياً
    نقبل مقترحات بالعربية والإنجليزية والفرنسية والإسبانية والبرتغالية. وسيتم النظر
    في الطلبات بشكل دوري. . \n\n\n- يُمكن للأفراد التقدم بطلب حتى 500 دولار. \n- يُمكن
    للمنظمات التقدم بطلب حتى 2000 دولار.\n- يُمكن للمشاريع الجماعية التقدم بطلب حتى
    2500 دولار. \n\n\n### عملية تقديم الطلبات\n\n\n- ينبغي على المتقدمين ملء [نموذجاً
    الكترونياً](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1da3cFbo7lwzegjv2roLQP0WBT3kDSnsO8rE-Zd95DZ0/prefill)
    يصفون به مقترحهم بالتفصيل \n-  تجتمع اللجنة الاستشارية للصندوق كل أسبوع لمراجعة
    جميع الطلبات\n- سيتم إخطار المتقدمين الناجحين خلال فترة من 5 إلى 10 أيام من تاريخ
    تقديم الطلب\n\n\n\n### معايير الاختيار\n- __الأصالة ودرجة الأهمية__: جودة الطلب
    المكتوب. ما التحديات التي يقترح معالجتها؟ ما منطقته الجغرافية/تركيزه الجغرافي؟\n-
    __قابلية التحقيق__: هل سيكون المتقدم قادراً على الإيفاء بوعوده المذكورة في الطلب؟
    هل خطة العمل واقعية في الإطار الزمني المُقترح؟ هل يُمثِّل العمل الميداني أي قضايا
    متعلقة بالأخلاق والصحة والسلامة لا بد من وضعها في عين الاعتبار؟  \n- __الأثر والتعميم__:
    هل يحدد الطلب جمهوراً معنياً بالعمل؟ كيفية تخطيط العمل لتغيير التصور بشأن كوفيد-19؟
    هل الطلب واضح من حيث سبب أهمية هذا العمل الآن؟ سيتم إعطاء الأولوية للمشاريع التي
    تخدم المجتمعات المحلية والمجتمعات المحرومة والنساء والمجموعات ثنائية الجندر و
    الأقليات، وسكان الأقاليم .\n- __الدقة__: هل ستلتزم بمنهجية تدقيق الحقائق؟ كيف
    سيتحقق المتقدم من دقة مصادره؟ هل المصادر المستخدمة في حملة التربية الإعلامية الخاصة
    بك تعد موثوقة؟\n\nالرجاء ملاحظة أنه إذا لم تتلق منا رداً خلال ثلاثة أسابيع من
    تاريخ تقديم طلبك، فهذا يعني أن طلبك غير موَّفق. ويؤسفنا القول بأنه لا يُمكننا
    على الرد على كل طلب غير موَّفق بسبب كمية الطلبات الكبيرة التي نتلقاها.  \n\nسيقوم
    المتقدمين المقبولين بنشر مشاريعهم على منصاتهم الخاصة وسيشار إليها أيضاً في صفحة
    \"تشيك جلوبال\". وسيتم إبرازها لاحقاً على مدونتنا في نهاية هذه الدورة التمويلية.

    Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going viral, stigmatizing

    Network. This is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
    working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin America
    (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA). \n\nWe aim to provide
    a platform that strengthens and facilitates the work of organizations committed
    to promoting the development of people that have faced historic and systemic barriers
    in entering the fields of media and technology.\n\nOur most impactful partnerships
    are currently with women-led organizations and feminist networks using media to
    promote feminist leadership and rights in emerging economies of the Global South.
    The Check Global Network is now expanding to new areas and new partners. As part
    of this phase of expansion, we are actively seeking partnerships with groups that
    embed feminist values and concepts of social justice into organizational practices.
    \n\nThe Check Global Network is a community for sharing, learning and reflection.
    The network activities will be led by Meedan. In this process we will draw upon
    skills of Meedan team members, the network members themselves as well as those
    of other partners and institutions that we have worked with in different regions
    over the last decade. \n\nThe main activities of the network will focus on capacity
    building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational development,
    providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be part of a growing
    impactful community. \n\n__Forums for engagement__: \n- We’ll invite Check Global
    Network members to participate in virtual and in person learning events that we
    organise. \n- We will recommend members for conferences, fellowships, internships,
    training programs and other structured learning opportunities.\n- Meedan’s weekly
    newsletter, [The Checklist](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=8fa4ab9399),
    will feature the work of network members and will provide them regular updates
    on misinformation. \n- Meedan will design collaborative and time-bound projects
    that meet the needs of network members and provide opportunities to respond to
    global issues. \n\n__To join the network, please write to us at <a href=\"mailto:checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com\">checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com</a>

  body: "### The 2020 Global Misinfodemic Report examines the impact of COVID-19 outside
    of the Global North\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the 2020 Global Misinfodemic
    Report, a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information scholars,
    legal experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining the impacts
    of COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Brazil
    and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts and journalists
    from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and fact-checking organizations,
    the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation into the way this unprecedented
    viral event is both reforming and confirming the state of our global information
    ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, as countries worked to contain the
    first signs of the physical virus spreading, a secondary crisis occured: misinformation
    on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
    [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
    and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
    \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
    UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
    and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health advice
    and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the airwaves.
    Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going viral, stigmatizing
    and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against this disease, too.”\n\nA
    misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
    and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
    leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
    interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
    approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report touches
    on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are spreading
    online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating with certain
    communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation on  public
    health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging economies?\n-
    What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe first
    wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed world,
    but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New York Times
    editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies ahead is the
    spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict, through packed
    refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh, through
    teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social distancing
    is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without the fiscal
    capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would be disastrous
    not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies of raw materials
    are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger and the virus
    doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely to ensue, long
    after countries in North America and Europe control their initial outbreaks, is
    sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about the pandemic.
    In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our partners’ fact-checking
    tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched COVID-19 misinformation
    evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments involving tea, vitamins,
    hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation about penalties for
    spreading misinformation or just spreading information, about the pandemic \n-
    Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this misinformation can trigger
    real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing the most obvious and
    harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where [people are dying
    from drinking Methanol after false and misleading information circulated on social
    media about its use as a treatment](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/nearly-500-people-dead-in-iran-after-drinking-methanol-to-fight-off-covid-19-1.4870674).
    In other regions, the misinfodemic materializes as public trust in leadership
    weans and citizens look to sometimes misguided informal leaders for answers to
    complex scientific information. \n\nAs both the physical and online virus rages
    on into the summer, the Global Misinfodemic Report will begin publishing groups
    of articles from contributors around the world. Look back here or [sign up for
    our newsletter](https://meedan.com/checklist) for updates on when to expect the
    first batch of articles. "

  title: 'Updating Meedan''s Code of Conduct '
  slug: updating-meedans-code-of-conduct
  body: "With the growth of Meedan's community efforts, including [the launch of the
    Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/)
    and our open source development community, alongside our ongoing work on the [Credibility
    Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/), we have spent time updating our
    Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies across our organizational efforts,
    both internally and externally. This is built on the work of communities we respect,
    such as the Internet Freedom Festival, Geek Feminism Wiki, Open Source and Feelings
    Conference, and individuals who are working to make their communities safe and
    welcoming.\n\n\nA summary can be found here:\n\n\n\nMeedan is committed to providing
    an inclusive, safe, and collaborative environment for all participants in events,
    regardless of their gender, gender expression, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual
    orientation, sexual characteristics, physical appearance, disability, or age.
    We encourage every participant to be themselves, and must respect the rights of
    others.\nThe code of conduct is a set of guidelines that establishes shared values
    and ensures that behaviors that may harm participants are avoided.\n\nThe values
    of the Meedan community are focused on developing both our individual and collective
    potential, supporting and empowering the most marginalized, mutual respect, and
    an anti-violence approach that favors support and collaboration among participants
    and the resolution of conflicts.\nA code of conduct helps us co-exist in a more
    positive way, and provides individuals who are victims of negative behaviors with
    confidence that they will be supported by the organization and Meedan community,
    who respects and stands behind the code of conduct.\n\nMeedan works towards providing
    a welcoming environment where participants are treated with dignity and respect
    and are free to be themselves. We encourage all participants to approach the event
    with an open and positive attitude, engaging constructively with others at all
    times.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n\nBy attending a Meedan event or participating
    in Meedan forums, we all agree to the following code of conduct\n\n\n### Respect
    for Diversity & Inclusion\n\nWe avoid comments, actions or propaganda that encourages
    discrimination related to gender, gender expression, race, ethnicity, religion,
    sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, physical appearance, disability, or
    age.\n\n### Respect Freedom of Expression\n\nWe support an individual's freedom
    of expression, and will not make fun of accents or make unsolicited grammatical
    corrections. We will strive to better understand each other by not assuming experiences
    or beliefs, clarifying meanings, and making an effort to speak clearly, avoiding
    jargon and acronyms.\n\n### Commitment to Non-Violence  \n\nWe will not engage
    in any type of violence or aggression, including verbal threats or complaints,
    intimidation, stalking or harassment, whether physically or psychologically.\n\nBe
    mindful of people who have experienced trauma. Let someone leave a conversation
    that makes them uncomfortable, and do not follow people who asked to be left alone.
    If you discuss difficult topics that may be traumatic for participants, provide
    warnings so people may leave a conversation or plan coping strategies. For content
    warnings:\n\nUse CW (content warning) at the beginning of your post or message,
    with a short description of the traumatic content. For example: \n\n*CW (content
    warning) for gender-based violence*\n*CW (content warning) description of racist
    incident* \n*CW (content warning) anxiety* \n*CW (content warning) medical procedure*
    \n\nOn Slack, write the content warning, then reply to your own message with the
    potentially traumatic content to create a thread. \n\nFor text-only messaging,
    provide the content warning and add several new lines before the potentially traumatizing
    content. \n\nThere are topics you may not realize need a content warning. If you
    are asked to provide a content warning and have questions, contact us for explanations
    instead of asking the traumatized person to teach you. Your moderation team is
    happy to provide guidance! \n\n### Rejection of Sexual Harassment  \n\nWe understand
    sexual harassment as unwanted physical contact or insinuation of a sexual nature,
    as well as displaying images, drawings or visual representations of any kind that
    objectify members of any gender or reinforce oppression. The only exception is
    if this is part of a session, workshop and/or educational experience where showing
    these images is educational in nature. \n\n### Respect for Privacy  \n\nWe safeguard
    the privacy of the participants, and agree to follow Meedan's privacy policy.
    This includes refraining from tweeting, posting, or publishing information about
    attendees (including names and affiliation) unless given clear permission, and
    avoid any type of unauthorized video, audio recording, or photography.\n\n###
    Facilitate Participation & Collaboration  \n\nWe work to create an environment
    that facilitates participation for all participants, and that session presenters
    are given respect. We will not engage in sustained disruption of sessions or events,
    interrupt conversations in a way that negatively impacts collaboration, or engage
    in toxic behaviors to attract negative attention to an attendee.\n\n### We Care
    about the Integrity and Health of the Community  \n\nWe value the health of the
    community and will not engage in behavior that can negatively impact it. This
    includes contaminating food or drink with drugs, or inciting or insisting on the
    consumption of alcohol, psychoactive substances, etc.\n\n### Support Positive
    Interactions Among Participants \n\nWe are committed to engaging constructively
    with others at all times. We will not tolerate bullying, including requesting
    or mobilizing others, either in person or online, to bully others.\n\nWe recognize
    that disagreements, especially about technology, are a necessary part of the software
    development process. However, argument cultures can be counterproductive. When
    disagreeing with someone:\n\n1. Address the idea, not the person. People of all
    experience levels make errors. People of all experience levels can learn more
    about the people our technology helps.\n\n2. People choose different technology
    stacks and operating systems to meet their unique needs. The use of one type of
    device does not render someone's opinion more or less valid.\n\n3. We are committed
    to help people learn, and to learn from them. We do not require that all participants
    act as mentors. If an opportunity for mentorship emerges, and you prefer not to
    be a mentor, we will find a match in the community.\n\n4. If you need help with
    the discussion, please get in touch with the code of conduct team, and we will
    be happy to moderate.\n\n\n\n\n\n__Overseeing the COC  __\n\nThe Meedan team will
    be overseeing the Code of Conduct, including addressing all incident reports.
    Breaking the code of conduct may result in immediate expulsion from the event
    or forum.\n\n__How  to Report an Incident  __\n\nIf you witness an incident or
    are the victim of one, there are several ways to report it to the Meedan team.
    \n\n 1. During conferences, we will provide email addresses and phone numbers
    to attendees. This information will be provided during registration and on site.
    The response team will be introduced during opening remarks and you can ask at
    the registration point for a member of the response team to meet you. \n 2. You
    can email them at codeofconduct@meedan.com\n 3. You can contact the Meedan team
    directly immediately on our forums. The username of the person responsible for
    the Code of Conduct will be listed in the copy of the Code of Conduct on the forum
    documentation, README files, and pinned posts.\n    \nWe use encrypted email and
    messengers, so if you're more comfortable with another messenger app, let your
    moderators know. All reports are kept confidential. We will not reveal your name
    or other information without your consent. \n"
