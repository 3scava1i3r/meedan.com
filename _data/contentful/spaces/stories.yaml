    In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

    Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

    ## Check in India

    In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

    ![A snapshot of Check in action in India](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7ByjlM8ANw0DQKaFgilv7k/75663509b60dee23c990ceea2696068a/check-in-india.png)

    In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

    The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

    In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months.

    ## Check in Indonesia

    In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

    Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

    > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

    ## Check in the Philippines

    The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

    The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
    “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

    In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

    Conversations on family WhatsApp groups in India can be exhausting. *“Your bank has gone bust. Its share prices have dropped. Before you lose your life savings, find a reliable bank and transfer all your money.”* My anxious family members shared this message on one of our many family WhatsApp groups.

    The language and style of the message looked dubious to me. A few inquiries and one good fact-check relieved me: My bank was safe! Before I could share the good news on the family group, there was another forward that family members did not want anyone to miss. A big chocolate brand was gifting free chocolate hampers for Diwali! Before I could alert family members to not fall for the new hoax, there was mayhem on the group. The number of chocolate boxes purportedly being gifted increased with each message! So my little alert was buried in an avalanche of chocolate discussion among very excited young and old members of my family.

    Studies have shown that trust in the person sharing a message on closed messaging apps like WhatsApp is a key indicator of the message being shared multiple times. It is because of this trust that even suspicious looking messages are spread. I often talk with friends about this; *“What is the right strategy to call out family members sending fake news on WhatsApp groups?” “I can’t stop being Judge Judy on my family WhatsApp groups and people hate me for that.” “The last time I told my uncle his message was fake, he made a nasty comment and ignored me at the next family gathering.”*

    From first-hand experience running newsrooms, I can tell you that fact-checkers in India face similar concerns to my friends and I. I once met a media marketing manager who managed 60 WhatsApp groups. I wondered how he kept track of important messages. Shortly after that interaction, my newsroom went from print to digital, and I found myself on at least 40 WhatsApp groups that had media persons and other local professionals. The barrage of good morning messages did not stop until early evening. Group members were happy to share all kinds of unsolicited advice about personal or professional issues. Birthdays and anniversaries are big in India, and wishes, memes, songs on these occasions started from midnight and never ended! Amidst all this, fake information filtered into these groups as well. It was nearly impossible to keep track of conversations and information.

    What is the solution to this? Will we just learn to live surrounded by a fog of noise and misinformation?

    *“There’s a lot of noise on WhatsApp. Ignoring it is not an option; this is the pulse of conversations around us today. Addressing it is a challenge because of the clutter.”* My conversations with fact-checkers in India indicate high levels of exhaustion just from monitoring incoming messages on WhatsApp. Many of them work with limited resources and small teams. Managing a helpline on WhatsApp is not easy; from employment related inquiries to requests for setting up appointments with celebrities — fact-checkers have dealt with it all. There’s also video calls from users at all hours, pornographic content, trolls, these are also concerns flagged by fact-checkers in India.

    So how do fact-checking initiatives cope with this? Well…

    - Some have had to discontinue their helplines
    - Others have to scroll through several messages to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones
    - Fact-checkers are also relying on other social media platforms to look for relevant information to address. “We can’t not address misinformation on WhatsApp”, the last fact-checker I met said.

    #### Check is here to help!

    Meedan’s digital tool, Check, has features that can provide solutions to messages on closed apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was introduced to Check last year when I learned about Verificado, a collaborative election reporting and fact-checking project in Mexico. In March this year I was actively using Check while working on Checkpoint, a research project around the 2019 Indian general election where Check integrated with the WhatsApp Business API.

    As a Check journalist, there are many tasks that the tool simplified

    - I didn’t have to look at a WhatsApp number everyday to find relevant election related messages
    - It was possible for me to collaborate with other team members, even those members who were not physically present in the same space, because we all had access to the same feed
    - Finding important messages buried in a heap of junk also became easier because of Check
    - Keeping track of work and looking at patterns of misinformation was another task where different features of Check came in handy.

    I saw the potential of Check to perform many more tasks to help fact-checkers, journalists, activists and researchers. As a team member leading Meedan’s work in the Asia Pacific region, I am now engaging with new partners and introducing Check to their workflows. I understand the concerns of journalists and fact-checkers well, and some of their concerns are now on the roadmap for Meedan’s team to improve Check and enhance its features. As a Meedan team member, I understand how Check can be positioned in the work of organizations and how its existing features can be applied effectively. It’s a dynamic relationship and it’s a good place to be in.

    Before I joined Meedan as a software engineer in late 2011, this amazing team had already noticed that new media was ending the scarcity in which mass media journalism functioned. This was having repercussions for both newsgathering and publishing—no longer were audiences solely reliant on foreign reporters to tell the story. This was particularly true of the reporting of the Middle East, where citizen media been used so powerfully in the midst of such colossal social and political change during the Arab Spring. And citizen media should be verified.

    That’s when Meedan started working on this problem — clearly a very difficult nut to crack. It all started with a participatory liveblog with leading Egyptian independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.

    ![The Early Days: Checkdesk 1.0](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1pyqrBpzaGsslnQzRhWQbq/99411e1d90054d975042df1d3243377a/1_vhGxiy0adssnlxAxPYO91Q.png)

    Less than one year after I joined Meedan, around October 2012, the software engineering team (myself included) started working on a second iteration of this platform for collaborative fact-checking, which at that point was called Checkdesk, which we launched in July 2013.

    Checkdesk was a verification desk for the digital newsroom, designed to help curate user-generated content during breaking news and to connect journalists to citizen sources on the ground. We developed it in cooperation with six leading media outlets in the MENA region: Al Masry Al Youm and Welad El Balad Media Services in Egypt, 7iber in Jordan, Nahar Ashabab and Social Media Exchange (SMEX) in Lebanon, Ma’an Network in Palestine, and Al-Ayyam in Syria.

    ![Checkdesk 2.0 in action by Bellingcat](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/5hGviBzBImRaJ9H6kj2QvJ/6f2de5304cc654ba0983ec1a96bab305/1_v1g4OUFLKHmvwSv_ChhYRQ.gif)

    From a technological perspective, Checkdesk was built as a monolithic web application using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), an open source platform for web content management. As a CMS, Drupal was among the most successful and seemed like a great fit for our needs, because it strikes a great balance between getting up and running in no time, and the ability to extend its functionality almost infinitely. It served us quite well between 2013 and early 2016 and during that time we had the opportunity to [make numerous contributions to its community](https://www.drupal.org/node/2343639) and attend some Drupal conferences to share all the expertise we gained with that work.

    As our applications grew, we started facing scalability challenges with Drupal. These challenges manifested in many ways, from code maintainability to lower performance, proliferation of defects and automated testing. It was time for us to rethink our software architecture. We had to implement more features, go mobile, support more languages, handle more content, serve more users and face new social events—mainly elections.

    We accepted a big challenge at that time, which was to completely rewrite Checkdesk, in six months, from scratch, with a completely new code base.

    Personally, I had some good pre-Meedan experience with the open source web application framework [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) since 2009. During my early days at Meedan I had the opportunity to implement a prototype in Ruby On Rails for social media translation, which was called Translatedesk. This prototype evolved into a micro services architecture made of several Ruby On Rails APIs which were at the core of our translation product, [Bridge](https://meedan.com/en/bridge/).

    So we decided to pursue a similar software stack approach as Bridge and re-implemented Checkdesk as a multi-service application: some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs written in Ruby On Rails, a web application using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and, as usual, everything was released [as an open source project](https://github.com/meedan/check). We also started a new culture for our software development process, which includes writing automated tests for everything seeking [100% code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa/code), [continuous testing](http://travis-ci.org/meedan), [code quality with maximum GPA at Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa) and containerization of our softwares.

    Not only the code was rewritten, but also the branding: Checkdesk was brought out from behind the ‘desk.’ The 3.0 version of our open source software was rebranded as, simply, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    ![Checkdesk 3.0, a.k.a. Check](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1Dkor8b2zPH26RZptleGDl/da47acfd15d8a1a4ec964482baa491fb/1_pcz3ZoK-tD_C9gnM2CCpnw.png)

    Check provides a central workbench facilitating online verification newsroom collaboration, allowing participating journalists and editors a simple and powerful framework to work together to investigate and annotate links, media and claims. This new code base has been serving us well since then, and during that time we implemented many improvements, new features and performance enhancements in order to accommodate its increasing usage. Since we first released it in October 2016, it was used by OJA-winning election monitoring projects like [Electionland](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/checking-the-vote-how-check-was-used-during-electionland-4242dd875e4b) (United States, 2016), [CrossCheck](https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.org/france-fr/) (France, 2017) and [Verificado](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/verificado-2018-wins-major-collaboration-and-partnerships-award-e6812ecbbdf) (Mexico, 2018), in addition to similar projects in Asia, namely [Indonesia, Philippines and India](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/meedan-in-asia-how-check-supported-three-simultaneous-election-reporting-initiatives-9b6626e89e3a).

    In India we had a new big challenge to face: misinformation on WhatsApp. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/). In December 2018 we started to integrate Check into the WhatsApp business API and released this feature in early April 2019, just in time for the elections in India. Check Message was born: our tool for fact-checking against disinformation at scale, seeking scalability, reliability and great performance.

    ![Check Message architecture](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4YDeFFaKebhPeh3N1xAt9p/f3f144a5e8ebbd10c083377b3db57b89/1_QEFoJ2yG5LvjfQVew-oPyA.png)

    Our collaboration in India, called [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched in April as the first real use case of Check Message. In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification and our software was useful to group duplicate requests, allow similar items to be related, prioritize most requested items and, in general, optimize the fact-checker’s work as much as possible.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    After this first release, we generalized our software module from WhatsApp-specific to more platform-agnostic, and we now support other closed message platforms, like Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. This module was implemented as a Check bot. Check allows for extensible scripts and functions that help you augment your verification experience with tools like private messenger integration, archiving and language detection. We call these scripts [bots](https://github.com/meedan/check-bots), and they live in the [Bot Garden](https://medium.com/meedan-user-guides/bot-garden-user-guide-adc2c1d743f3). We hope that this bot infrastructure can be used by other developers around the world to integrate Check with other tools and with their own workflows.

    We keep working on Check in order to improve user experience, content ingestion and augmented verification. Stay tuned! What I can say is that I’m really enjoying the things we are working on right now and really excited for the next challenges we’ll face and the new software support we’ll implement in the upcoming years in order to make Check even more global. I invite everyone to join us on that. If you are a software developer interested in open source and in these challenges we’re tackling, get in touch on [GitHub](http://github.com/meedan). If you are journalist and want to use Check for your project, get in touch with us on our [website](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    Ultimately, it’s a collaborative effort.

  body: "Misinfodemics, a term coined in 2018 by Meedan researchers, is a phenomenon
    in which online health misinformation contributes to the spread of real world
    disease. \n\nThe Lab’s [new report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf) notes
    that at both individual and population levels, low-quality online content about
    health topics can influence vaccination rates and herd immunity, the appropriate
    use of antibiotics and treatment regimens, the adoption of response efforts in
    epidemics, and access to care for serious illnesses. \n\nThe impact that this
    is having on population health suggests it is critical and urgent to re-think
    and innovate around the way we approach health misinformation.\n\n[Read the report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)."

  body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
    misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
    content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
    since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
    published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election, to
    the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
    before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
    (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
    the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
    credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
    an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of it
    are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how to
    communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for content
    credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
    to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
    of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an initiative
    with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community group (CredWeb).
    [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
    (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
    to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
    documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
    to this issue.\n\n#### [Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment
    on the Web](https://credweb.org/report/20181011)\n\nThis is a vision document
    that captures a general technical approach for improving credibility assessment
    online. It captures everything from terminology to threat models and stakeholders,
    and it lays out some of our core vision for the potential of these standards.
    It’s a hefty lift, and we recommend taking some time to look through it and offer
    commentary.\n\nHere’s how it starts:\n\n*Can you tell, when looking at a random
    web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search
    results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are
    scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed
    and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda or outright lies?
    Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making
    some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods with
    your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making
    bad decisions for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous
    consequences?*\n\n*The Credible Web Community Group was formed at W3C, the organization
    which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological approaches
    to this “credibility assessment” problem. It’s not that we think technology can
    solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one,
    but it seems likely that some technology is making matters worse and that certain
    designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches
    to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.*\n\n\n#### [Credibility
    Signals](https://credweb.org/signals/)\n\nAfter reading through the above, it
    helps to dive into specifics. What do signals look like? In this document, we
    have an outline of some draft signals. They range from signals around rhetoric
    — does it show negative or positive valence? — to a typology around clickbait
    and what it means for a title to accurately represent the body content.\n\nHere’s
    how we frame the document:\n\n*This document is intended to support an ecosystem
    of interoperable credibility tools. These software tools, which may be components
    of familiar existing systems, will gather, process, and use relevant data to help
    people more accurately decide what information they can trust online and protect
    themselves from being misled. We expect that an open data-sharing architecture
    will facilitate efficient research and development, as well as an overall system
    which is more visibly trustworthy.*\n\n*The document has three primary audiences:*\n\n-
    *Software developers and computer science researchers wanting to build systems
    which work with credibility data. For them, the document aims to be a precise
    technical specification, stating what they need for their software to interoperate
    with any other software which conforms to this specification.*\n- *People who
    work in journalism and want to review and contribute to this technology sphere,
    to help make sure it is beneficial and practical.*\n- *Non-computer-science researchers,
    interested in helping develop and improve the science behind this work.*\n\nWe’re
    grateful to the many many participants who gave feedback on these documents in
    their early stages, and we’re looking forward to advancing them in our second
    year as a group. If you’re coming to [CredCon](http://www.credcon.org/), be sure
    to join our workshops and chat with CredWeb co-chair Sandro Hawke. Or, learn more
    about joining the group at [credweb.org](http://credweb.org/).\n\n\n\n\n"

    Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

    ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

    We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

    ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

    Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

    ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

    With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

    ![“Aerial Photos of flooding caused by Hurricane Florence” by S.C. Air National Guard](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3FLP519tmwF4fE0nWhoYaB/0747fcb183e0af1ddabf57d2e4c086d8/1_WUPR5tVJFJ_Z-X9hEhkPFQ.jpeg)

    ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

    The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

    ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

    Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.

  body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
    of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
    is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a global
    challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training sessions,
    host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and have network
    partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people, crossing borders,
    gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly global collaboration
    to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a global anti(in-person)-gathering.
    In Meedan terms: the future of our global town squares is dependent on our near
    term efforts to keep our physical town squares empty, and our digital town squares
    free of dangerous misinformation. \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19
    pandemic we are addressing the immediate needs of a global team and also working
    to develop programs that contribute to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing
    the lead of some other [inspiring organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
    \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and personal
    paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose school has
    been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members. We have closed
    our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have put a hold on
    the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.   \n\nLast week
    we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support for their health
    and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans, budgets, and project
    timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent and encouragement
    of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development Cooperation Agency.
    \ \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses. Last year we launched
    the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to health information as
    a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and Nat Gyenes framed some
    of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient piece in the Atlantic, [How
    Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
    \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous international
    bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable areas for
    civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with epidemiologists,
    public health communications experts, technology companies, and civil society
    partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository of annotated
    misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of our Check Global,
    Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies into this new program
    area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible threat to our emotional
    and physical well-being, I want to close this brief statement by saying perhaps
    this global project to stay apart might actually serve to bring together a world
    that is riven politically and ideologically. It’s going to take some brilliant
    and heroic collaborations to make it through the next several months and we are
    committed to doing what we can as an organization placed at the epicenter of misinformation
    response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist? Public Health Expert? Talented

  body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work remotely
    most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity for journalists,
    fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of COVID–19, the novel
    coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences focusing on Internet
    freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check), the
    project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
    from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
    Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in COVID-19-related
    content, and  public health and science communication experts have been helping
    us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to ensure  accurate information
    can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate health information usually
    spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities at risk, but this year it’s more
    critical for us to accomplish what we usually do at conferences. While we are
    disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues in person, there’s an opportunity
    here. There have always been many reasons to have a virtual conference, but now
    there are more people and organizations motivated to do something about it - there
    are entire industries going virtual. At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity
    and inclusion amongst both staff and partners. If we work on this issue during
    a pandemic, we can make conferences more accessible for everyone as a long term
    goal too. Participants from emerging economies often have difficulty getting visas
    to attend conferences. Global climate change has led several people to forgo airplane
    travel. Parents have to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some
    disabilities make travel difficult, and the disability activism community has
    long called for improvements to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote
    participation has been used by several conferences to enable attendance for people
    who cannot travel. While this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual
    conferences are not widespread, and they lack virtual versions of useful conference
    activities. Many of the open source tools we use were designed by covering walls
    in a massive number of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What
    do you need from a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions?
    What works for you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe
    started with the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2.
    Presenting product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5.
    One-on-one discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7.
    Un-conference formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe
    came up with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked
    at were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
    budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
    high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
    indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
    thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
    has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a disability,
    however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is not an option
    at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling. As long
    as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate with other
    participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant lives in a region
    or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection. Any virtual conference
    technology has to take low bandwidth environments into account.\n\n3. This participant
    has a passport or legal status that makes it difficult for them to travel. They
    often get rejected for visas, even when they are a featured speaker at a conference.
    \n\n3. This participant lives in a country that censors the Internet and arrests
    journalists. In order to participate safely, they can only go to conferences with
    a no photo or video policy, whether this is a blanket ban or attendee preferences
    can be signaled by the color of their conference lanyard. Any virtual conference
    technology must allow private access, allowances for pseudonyms, participation
    without voice or video, and possibly compatibility with censorship circumvention
    technologies.\n\n4. This participant is Deaf. Their technology needs may include
    live captioning, participation by typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video
    of presenters to enable lip reading, or clear audio from participants depending
    on their level of hearing and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant
    is blind. Virtual conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers,
    and presenters should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of
    their presentation materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems
    understanding one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation,
    or just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
    participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the presentation.
    They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the ability to ask questions
    of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who need mobility aids face obstacles
    when traveling. Wheelchair users often get broken chairs back from airlines. When
    these chairs are custom fit, there are no temporary replacements that can make
    participating in a conference a pain-free experience. Power wheelchairs are very
    expensive, so travel can mean gambling with one’s mobility for a long time after
    a conference. \n\n9. This participant has modest tech skills and may need help
    with operating the interface for online meetings. Usability is an access issue.
    \n\nWe’re working with our communities to make lasting change out of this emergency
    situation. The civic tech community is evaluating software and practices for conferences
    and hackathons. We’re also expanding our online developer community. Let’s build
    something together! \n\nEmail us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>
    to get started. "

  body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
    of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
    ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
    to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso, and
    Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with newsrooms,
    fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three continents.\n\nThis
    represents significant growth from previous years, allowing us to deepen our support
    for these regions with program leads who are deeply familiar with their local
    contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our amazing partners around the
    world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional leads, along with Wafaa Heikal,
    our long-running program manager who is now heading up our efforts in Africa and
    the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi
    is passionate about feminism and local journalism. Over the last two decades,
    her work has brought the two together. Shalini has studied misinformation, particularly
    on closed messaging platforms. She has been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International
    Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/) ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)).
    The fellowship focused on designing creative ways to counter misinformation. As
    a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/), ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini
    led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/) - a research project focused
    on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini started her professional
    journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/), a centre for gender education.
    She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented communities to come
    into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes. Shalini is
    the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (“News Waves”
    in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya is known
    for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women from some
    of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project is a testament
    to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent media is essential,
    as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini believes that
    [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can be a turning point
    for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation shared on closed messaging
    platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate, annotate, verify and archive
    misinformation and Shalini believes that for several small and independent newsrooms,
    this is a great service that no other platform currently provides. Check has tremendous
    potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers to design collaborative projects, especially
    around areas of common interest. Its unique features are great for large projects
    on politics, health, climate change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n###
    Meet Isabella Barroso in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa,
    is Meedan's Latin America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms
    in both Spanish and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's
    program team with a passion for human-centred design and product development that
    is fit to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design,
    Isa hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills
    in product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
    journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
    [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
    and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am now
    developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\" noted
    Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned a lot
    about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this happens
    with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America seems to
    be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging on
    closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
    overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
    Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in journalism.
    She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy to literature.
    \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with culture and social
    media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first job was as a culture
    journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
    due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
    came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
    of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
    I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
    open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
    the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
    media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
    with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news cycle.
    In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor and
    verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human rights
    researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
    annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
    open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support different
    workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate and what
    context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work across an
    interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with small teams
    and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring projects, understanding
    the particular national context and partner capacities and then designing new
    workflows around them.”\n\n"
