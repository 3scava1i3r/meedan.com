  description: On April 28, Kala Sung from Kala's Kimchi teaches us about the health
    benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting
    kimchi at home.
  long_description: |+
    In this SPACE10 Session, Kala Sung from Kala’s Kimchi teaches us about the health benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting kimchi at home.

    ### This Week
    Korean kimchi is a lacto-fermented food, usually made from napa cabbage, Korean radish or other vegetables. There is growing evidence that fermented foods such as kimchi may improve intestinal health and as a result support the immune system and anti-inflammatory responses (Kok & Hutkins, 2018). Chef Kala Sung will show us how to make kimchi at home, while delving further into science behind the health benefits of fermented foods and kimchi in particular.

    ### About the Guest
    Kala ‘Kimchi Kueen’ Sung is a Korean New Yorker, an experienced and renowned chef and MA of Food Studies from NYU. Kala travels the world with her creative and culinary workshop, Kala’s Kimchi. She adapts traditional fermenting techniques to local produce and is continually introducing modern twists while retaining kimchi’s distinctive qualities.

    ### How to Attend
    This SPACE10 Session is hosted on Zoom. You can sign up by clicking the ‘Attend’ button below and submitting your name, email address, and location. From then on, just download Zoom so you’re ready to go — it should all take two minutes in total.

  description: Join veteran journalist and Rappler co-founder Maria Ressa in conversation
    with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist, to discuss reporting
    barriers during COVID-19. June 18 on Zoom.
  long_description: "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, free flow of reliable and independent
    information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However,
    with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people have
    limited access to independent information, and few spaces  to dialogue and discuss
    the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain the pandemic.
    This challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly complex and evolving
    information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers are expected to
    distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious disease.\n\nPeople
    need news and information they can trust. Instead of making this available, governments
    are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information and scrutinising voices
    that seek accountability. \n\nIn order to analyse and discuss potential solutions
    to the current misinfodemic, Meedan is hosting an online event titled, ‘Reporting
    Barriers During COVID-19. The session will have veteran journalist and co-founder
    of Rappler, Maria Ressa in conversation with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning
    medical journalist. Maria has been leading the fight for freedom of press in the
    Philippines. For her courage and work on disinformation, Maria was named Time
    Magazine’s 2018 Person of the Year, was among its 100 Most Influential People
    of 2019, and has also been named one of Time's Most Influential Women of the Century.
    Seema was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team
    from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected
    diseases.\n\nLive on Zoom\n[Register now to sign up for the Zoom event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n\n##
    About the Series: Women, Media and the Pandemic\nThis event is first in the Check
    Global Network’s webinar series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’. Launched on May
    5, 2020, Check Global members are currently located in the Philippines, Indonesia,
    Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mexico. As a community
    of independent media, technology and human rights groups, the Check Global Network
    plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges, to design collaborative
    projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners in emerging economies.
    \n\nFor more information about joining the network, please write to us at checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com
    with a statement of interest.\n\nThe event will be hosted on Zoom on June 18,
    2020 at 11PM Manila/8:30 PM Delhi/ 5PM CET/ 11AM ET/ 8AM PT. We will share Zoom
    details with you once you have signed up!\n\n[REGISTER NOW](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n##

    of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of al-Qaeda’s Newest Center of Operations in
    Southeast Asia and From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years
    of Terrorism.\n\n__Seema Yasmin__ is an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist,

    in medicine at the University of Cambridge.\n\nYasmin was a finalist for the Pulitzer
    Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning News and received

    health, race and racism in America.
  long_description: "What do we know about why COVID-19 impacts Black Americans more
    aggressively than others? Can tear gas make COVID-19 worse? Will recent protests
    lead to an outbreak, or second wave of infections? Can we trust antibody tests
    to tell who has been infected and who hasn't?\n\nOn the heels of nation-wide protests
    against police brutality and amid systemic racism in America, health desks are
    now asking how race, systemic bias, police tactics and protests impact COVID-19.
    \n\n__Dr. Seema Yasmin__, an Emmy-award winning journalist and medical doctor
    joins Instagram Live with __Dr. Christin Gilmer__, a Global Health Scientist with
    a background in infectious diseases, international health systems, and population
    health and technology. \n\nTogether, the two experts are set to discuss top highlights
    from the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/), focusing
    specifically on public health conversations around race and racism in America.\n"

  description: Text similarity algorithms can help fact-checkers locate misinformation,
    cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks when operating
    tip lines on end-to-end encrypted platforms.
  long_description: |-
    Misinformation about COVID-19 has led to severe harms in multiple instances: as an example, a rumor that drinking methanol would cure the virus resulted in hundreds of deaths. While end-to-end encryption is an important privacy safeguard, this encryption prevents platforms such as WhatsApp, Signal, and others from employing centralized interventions and warnings about misinformation. Several options, however, from user interface changes to tip lines to having more intelligence on client devices offer hope.

    In this presentation Dr Scott A. Hale will discuss how text similarity algorithms are being used to help fact-checkers locate misinformation, cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks in the context of tip lines on platforms with end-to-end encryption. The presentation will detail research at the Oxford Internet Institute and Meedan, a global technology not-for-profit developing open-source tools for fact-checking and translation, that is actively being used by fact-checkers to improve the information available online.

    The session will be a 30 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of questions. Dr Chico Camargo, Postdoctoral Researcher in Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, will moderate the session.

    **Dr Scott A. Hale** is a Senior Research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford; Director of Research at Meedan; and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His cross-disciplinary research develops and applies new techniques in the computational sciences to social science questions and puts the results into practice with industry and policy partners. He is particularly interested in mobilization/collective action, agenda setting, and antisocial behaviour (e.g., hate speech) and has a strong track record in building tools and teaching programmes that enable wider access to new methods and forms of data.

  description: Natural language processing and semantic change can help policymakers,
    public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep a finger on the
    pulse of the online health conversation.
  long_description: "We are in extraordinary times, but even prior to the pandemic
    thousands of health conversations were happening on social media everyday. In
    2019, Meedan's Digital Health Lab in collaboration with researchers at the Oxford
    Internet Institute, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and University
    of Michigan's Department of Computer Science developed and tested approaches to
    help policymakers, public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep
    a finger on the pulse of the online health conversation. By modifying semantic
    change detection methods, we found we could identify when health words were being
    used in new, unexpected ways. Many of these shifts were due to large external
    events, but a few were due to misinformation. \n\nThe research is [detailed in
    an 8-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzyr1e9tSJs&list=PLEcKYh_fjP9hsDdFjnRkxFdDKARmivAPg&index=13
    \"Presentation of the research on YouTube\") and will be discussed at Global Fact
    7, the annual conference of the International Fact-Checking Network on Wednesday,
    June 24."
