      <p class="meta"><strong>Salary:</strong> Commensurate with qualifications and experience</p>

      <p>With generous support from the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), Meedan is embarking on Check Global, a remarkable new project to develop a verification and anti-disinformation network of partners in the Middle East and North Africa Region, in East Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.
