  <p class="intro">Meedan is a hybrid nonprofit/for-profit organization. We share code, people, offices, and values across two companies: <em>Meedan.org</em> is a registered 501(c) 3 established in 2006 that works on non-commercial projects to support global journalism. <em>Meedan Labs</em> is a for-profit spun off in 2014 to develop software for collaborative social media translation. This Annual Report reflects the state of Meedan.org and its financial health.

    <h2>CEO&rsquo;s Note</h2>

    <p>2014 will go down in the history books as a year the world failed to improve itself. With a majority of our programing in the Arab region, Meedanâ€™s work and partners have been reporting on, but also living through, this failure. Meedanis (the people of Meedan) and our partners have been, through this year, continuing our work in journalism and translation.  Our social media verification platform Checkdesk-enabled partners like the Egyptian hyperlocal media initiative Welad El Belad, the Syrian media collective Shabab Souria, and the UK-based Open Journalism pioneers Bellingcat to do reporting on the region that has entered into and influenced the international debate.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Meedan builds web and mobile tools and implements creative projects for journalists and translators. Like our namesake the Arabic town square, our tools serve as a gathering place for talented people working to add context to the social web. Our approach is human-centered, creative, and ambitious. Our partners are a world-class group of media companies, universities, and NGOs. We look to a world where understanding facilitated by global conversation is a bit wider, deeper, and more effective.
      </p>

      <p>To get there, we want to build the best tools and platforms in support of global journalism and translation. We are a team of designers, technologists and journalists who focus on open source investigation of digital media and crowdsourced translation of social media. With our partners, we support research, curriculum development, and new forms of digital storytelling.
