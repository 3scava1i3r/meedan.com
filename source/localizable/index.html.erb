      <h4>Pop Up Newsroom</h4>

      <p><a href="https://popup.news/">Pop-Up Newsroom</a> was founded in 2017 by Dig Deeper Media and Meedan and is an innovation framework for newsrooms that are changing the way they collaborate, communicate and engage audiences through new tools and training. Our structured approach to innovation — both technological and editorial — is unique.</p>

      <p>The Pop-Up Newsroom team have been involved in leading a number of large, high-profile social monitoring and verification projects since 2016: from Electionland in the US, to CrossCheck in France, <em>#GE2017</em> in the UK and <em>#Verificado2018</em> in Mexico. In 2018 and 2019 we have Pop-Up Newsrooms planned to aid election coverage in Sweden, Latvia, India and for the European elections. We are also planning Pop-Up Newsrooms to improve innovation in social monitoring, digital news gathering, disaster coverage and local journalism across Europe.</p>

      <h4>Credibility Coalition</h4>

      <p><a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">The Credibility Coalition</a> is a diverse, interdisciplinary community committed to improving information ecosystems and media literacy through transparent and collaborative exploration. Rather than jointly deciding whether an article is “credible” or “not credible” or endorsing any single index or evaluation of credibility, the Credibility Coalition fosters the development of a framework around which credibility can be discussed and interpreted.</p>

      <p>Our goal is to provide a range of indicators that can be used by a person — or a system — to gauge if an article can inform or educate that person (or whoever the audience is likely to be).</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="initiative">
      <h4>Path</h4>

      <p>Path is a research innovation framework for equitable access to information. We collaborate with health experts, journalists, activists and end-users to better understand how health information moves across the web. We apply participatory methods to ensure accessibility, diversity and representation in the algorithms and data that inform digital health initiatives. We design creative interventions for health information.</p>

      <p>The Path project emphasizes that information equity is a public health issue. There is an urgent need to develop co-designed, structured health datasets and accessible, engaging outputs, working with a community of health researchers, practitioners, journalists, and the public, so surfaced health content in online settings actually reflects the needs of individuals searching for information.</p>
