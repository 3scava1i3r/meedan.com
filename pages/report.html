In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world, and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation was part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.

### Trust Crisis in Iran   

In the months leading up to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s official institutions. Following November 2019 protests that resulted in what is suspected to have been thousands of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the country’s wide-reaching military corps, and the (semi) elected Iranian government faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition, the downing and the subsequent coverup of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in January 2020 by the Guards led to a new round of protests (Behravesh, Jan. 14, 2020). 

As COVID-19 began to take hold in the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, President Rouhani, the Ministry of Health and other officials initially played down the pandemic, in fear that the virus  would lower voter turnout for the country’s February election (Al Jazeera, Feb. 23, 2020; BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020). Less reported in the media are the other issues and events that have eroded public trust against these authorities throughout the pandemic: Channels affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards and state affiliated news channels promoted conspiracy theories about the virus’s origins. Masaf Institute for example, a  cultural and economic institution affiliated with Revolutionary Guard under the leadership of a well-known and cult-like conspiracy theorist, Ali Akbar Raefipour, stood out amongst these channels. They used their “health” Telegram channel called @masaf_salam as well as it’s main channel @masaf, to promote a wide range of conspiracies about the origins of the virus. Other accounts belonging or affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards such @afsaran_ir, @sepah_cyberi, @sepahcyberi were also actors promoting such theories. However, they further dramatized and promoted conspiracy theories that were being promoted in Iran’s official media regarding the virus as an attack by the US against Iran.
