  <h3>Our History</h3>
  <p>Since 2011, the Checkdesk project has worked to build online tools, support independent journalists, and develop media literacy training resources that aim to improve the investigative quality of citizen journalism and help limit the rapid spread of rumors and misinformation online.</p>

  <p>In addition to building software, we run workshops and panels, and we contributed to the European Journalism Centreâ€™s <a href="http://verificationhandbook.com/"><em>Verification Handbook</em></a>, edited by Craig Silverman, with case studies and an Arabic language translation.<p>
